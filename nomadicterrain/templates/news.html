In the end, history may record that the most revealing thing about President Trump’s rally in Tulsa last night was the way it was covered by the all-news networks. CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News had plugged the event as if it were the Pro Bowl. The anchors and reporters vamped for hours with pregame analysis and on-the-scene color shots as the big kickoff approached. And then the moment arrived and the time for commentary ended and … only Fox went ahead and aired the rally.I had my remote doing laps, hopping from one channel to the next. On Fox the president would be mugging and bellowing as his crowd went wild, and a few clicks away on the two liberal networks I’d find an anchor—Nicolle Wallace, Wolf Blitzer—encircled with pundits, Hollywood Squares style. In a split-screen frame or a corner box, you could see the president prowl and the commotion erupting soundlessly. Meanwhile the anchor and pundits reassured their viewers that the spectacle they weren’t letting them hear was appalling.What a choice for Saturday-night viewing: You could watch a preening blowhard surrounded by lickspittles chirping on cue, or you could watch Trump at his rally.[Read: Where was the ‘silent majority’?]Trump had high hopes for the rally, his first since the coronavirus pandemic (“the Covid,” in Trump lingo) began. At a White House gathering Thursday afternoon, the president said, “We’re going to be in Oklahoma. And it’s a crowd like, I guess, nobody’s seen before. We have tremendous, tremendous requests for tickets like, I think, probably has never happened politically before.” The unusual use of I guess and I think is a signifier of the president’s false modesty: he knew, with Trumpian certitude, that he was going to break some attendance records in Tulsa.It didn’t turn out that way, as the world knows, despite the best efforts of his publicists to insist otherwise. The most optimistic estimates put the BOK Arena at two-thirds full. As cameras scanned hectares of empty seats, the Fox News anchor, an emphatically incurious man named Jesse Watters, told his viewers, “It looks packed!” (Who ya gonna believe—me or my lyin’ cameras?) Trump’s down-bill warm-up acts—various members of his family mostly—pretended to marvel at the size of the crowd, turning their gaze upward as if they spied men in MAGA hats hanging from the rafters.Various news reports told us that the president was furious at the lower-than-expected turnout, and at first there were signs of it. For one thing he took the stage more or less on time and according to schedule; on more enjoyable occasions he has delighted in waiting backstage, prolonging the tension and letting the crowd’s temperature rise just short of full boil. And then, having taken the stage in Tulsa, he skipped the usual impromptu gests and goofs of a man whose highest aspiration is to be the center of attention of an adoring crowd. Instead he plunged straight into his scripted remarks as they unspooled from his teleprompter.Watching Trump read from a prompter is like watching a man slip into a straitjacket: the grimace, the grumble, the stiff movement of shoulders from side to side. “I stand before you to say …” It never lasts long. In Tulsa this businesslike efficiency, whatever its cause, quickly dropped away, and the president fell into his familiar ramble, returning now and then to the prepared speech. He uses the lines his speechwriters have provided him the way a swimmer uses a pool wall: touch, turn, and push—and then he’s off. (A pro tip for amateur Trump watchers: You know he’s back on the prompter when he stops gesticulating with both hands. When both hands are in play he’s riffing.)[David Frum: Trump’s 3-point plan to win in 2020]He spoke for an hour and 40 minutes. He gathered strength and volume as he went, working through set pieces about Veterans Affairs, the “Chinese virus,” the spendthrift Democrats, “Sleepy” Joe Biden in his—Biden’s—basement, and a golden oldie about Trump’s negotiations with Boeing over the price of a new presidential plane (an account that wound around to NATO and Angela Merkel and troop withdrawals from Germany and then to … D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser?). The chaotic course Trump’s stories take is often hard to follow, owing usually to the president’s peculiar shorthand. The word they, for example, will often appear in back-to-back sentences with different, unspecified referents. In one brief span Saturday night they wanted to abolish ICE, go fight the bad guys, and open your mail. Sometimes he seems to be speaking a private language shared only between himself and his followers.Even so, it often happens that the president’s audiences flag before he does, and Trump has to rouse them with something fresh. So it was in Tulsa. “People come up to me, they say, ‘How do you take it?’” he said. “I say, ‘What choice to do I have?’” As an example of how badly he’s treated by “the fake news,” he told the story of his famously shaky walk down a ramp at West Point last week, and of his uncertain grip on the glass of water he sipped from during his speech to the graduating cadets there.Trump took nearly 15 minutes to tell the story. He reenacted his walk down the ramp not once but twice. Triumphantly he drank a glass of water without a tremor, and then tossed the glass aside theatrically, before turning away in disgust.Thus the country was treated to a stunning sight: the president of the United States imitating a caricature of the president of the United States as he is defined by a relentlessly hostile press corps. It was bizarre; it was postmodern, even. It was yet another insult to the dignity of the presidential office. It was also the bravura performance of a showman in full command of his gifts—an essential display for anyone who wants to understand Donald Trump or the people who love him. And unless you were watching live on Fox News you probably missed it.<br/><br/>

Childhood in an Anxious AgeIn May, Kate Julian wrote about why so many kids are so miserable—and what adults can do about it.Your article was clear, informative, and insightful. But one thing I believe you missed was the demographic-evolutionary account: We now live in a society in which parents’ eggs are—literally and figuratively—all in one small basket. If you have four kids, not only do you have less time to obsess about each, but you carry “reproductive insurance.” But with only one, or even two, the risk of failing to pass on your genes to future generations (likely processed in the unconscious rather than the conscious brain) is increased. So what do you do? You become highly protective!Jay BelskyRobert M. and Natalie Reid Dorn Professor, UC Davis
Davis, Calif.As the president of a small, rural, private liberal-arts college for eight years, I witnessed a threefold increase in the number of students accessing mental-health services during that time. Many students could not effectively cope with independence and individual responsibility when left to themselves.While exploring the cause of the rise of student mental-health disorders, I learned that too many parents remained electronically and psychologically tethered to their children. Kate Julian’s reporting in the May 2020 issue should be required reading.Richard H. Dorman, D.Ed.Westerville, OhioIn both my work as an educator and my role as a parent of three small children, I have witnessed the contagious anxiety that Kate Julian describes. To her point that anxiety travels in families, I would add that it travels in communities. At playgrounds, my wife and I have been repeatedly admonished by other parents for letting our 3- and 4-year-old girls wander to the other side of the playground and climb or slide by themselves. At times, other parents have taken it upon themselves to hover in our place, because, they said, they “didn’t know where the parents were.” I wonder how many of those hovering parents were acting so protectively by choice and how many were doing it because of social pressure. It’s great that people want to look out for children’s safety in their community, but they should also respect parents’ decisions to have a seat on the park bench and let their kids learn how to climb—and maybe fall—on their own.Neal AllarTempe, Ariz.One of the great secrets of child psychologists is that most of our work takes place with grown-ups. Kate Julian did a masterful job of walking the line between blaming parents and ignoring them. I hope this is not the end of the story, but rather a jumping-off point for further discussion.T.

Jackson, Miss.Exile in the Age of ModiAatish Taseer wrote about how Hindu nationalism has trampled the founding idea of his country (May).What an extraordinarily forceful and perceptive piece Mr. Taseer has written. My own family members were Baghdadi Sephardim who landed in Bombay in the mid-19th century, as the British were developing the city into the subcontinent’s western export hub (we built the city’s first deepwater dock, which is still in daily use). They then rode a spectacular Indian-cotton bubble created by the Union naval blockade of the Confederate States, which starved the English mills of raw material—a bubble that ultimately transformed Bombay from a backwater marsh into the wealthy metropolis it is today. I wonder what future ironies we have in store, for a future “Bharat.”Tim SassoonVenice, Calif.Aatish Taseer wrote a thoughtful and poignant essay on the ways in which India is changing for the worse during Narendra Modi’s prime ministership. But a couple of clarifications are needed.First, the Overseas Citizenship of India is a pretend citizenship. It grants a lifelong visa with some accompanying rights, such as buying property. But with an OCI card, you need a valid foreign passport to enter the country; you cannot get an Indian passport, you cannot vote, and you cannot hold any office that requires you to be a citizen. Canceling Taseer’s OCI card on a clearly trumped-up charge was a travesty and cruel both to him and to his mother. But that does not excuse such sloppiness on a crucial distinction: He was not a citizen before the cancellation.Second, it is true that in the riots in Delhi in February, “Hindus and Muslims alike were killed.” But not in equal numbers, and the implied equivalency gives an undeserved pass to Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. The Guardian reported that at least three-quarters of those killed were Muslims.Ramesh ThakurCanberra, AustraliaAatish Taseer replies:Ramesh Thakur is right that the use of citizenship in Overseas Citizenship of India is the government’s language. The government offers this document as the closest thing to dual citizenship, which India doesn’t allow. It is indeed a kind of fraud, and new policies make the possibility of revoking the OCI still easier. I don’t think any of this takes away from the fact that it was my only means of living and working in the country where I grew up—and it was canceled on grounds that make it impossible for me to go home.As for Thakur’s second point, it’s a sad truth about communal riots in India that many of them result in more Muslims killed than Hindus. My aim was not to suggest equivalency, but rather to make clear that there were casualties on both sides.Q & AIn America, the coronavirus has revealed a sick and unequal society incapable of self-government, George Packer argued in June (“Underlying Conditions”). Here, he responds to readers’ questions about his essay.Q: How do the failings of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fit into your account of America as a failed state? — Katie Whitehead, Chatham, Va.A: In the article, I cite “a sclerotic bureaucracy” as one of the country’s “serious underlying conditions.” The CDC’s failings stemmed from both weak leadership and endemic bureaucratic obstacles. One solution would be getting rid of stupid red tape; a second would be empowering bureaucrats to act rather than making all the incentives negative, including the pervasive fear and demoralization that Donald Trump has instilled; a third would be to make the director’s job a career position rather than a political one.Q: Will anything change when this crisis is “over”? Given the entrenched political leadership, where will constructive approaches come from? — Marcia Goldstein, Laguna Woods, Calif.A: Reform in America comes slowly. Since the New Deal, it’s generally come from the national government, under pressure from popular movements. But political polarization and the Trump administration’s failure have devolved decision making. As they were 100 years ago, the states and localities will more and more be the laboratories of democracy. I hope there will also be a wave of ideas coming up from below, from experts and ordinary citizens alarmed by the failures of the American state.Behind the CoverIn our present-day politics, complicity is everywhere in evidence. Anne Applebaum’s cover story reminds us that the phenomenon has several damning historical precedents.

<a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/why-bill-barr-got-rid-geoffrey-berman/613339/?utm_source=feed'>Why Bill Barr Got Rid of Geoffrey Berman</a><br/><br/>
Late Friday evening, Attorney General Bill Barr claimed that the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York had resigned, and announced his replacement on an interim basis by the current U.S. attorney for New Jersey—a man who served as Chris Christie’s defense attorney in the Bridgegate scandal and who seems ill-equipped to handle the Manhattan caseload.That was a lie. A few hours later, the SDNY attorney, Geoffrey Berman, issued a public statement saying that he had not resigned, had no intention of doing so, and was staying on the job. Then, Saturday, Barr sent Berman a letter telling him that Barr had asked President Donald Trump to fire Berman—and that Trump had done so. That letter, too, may have been a lie. Shortly after it was published, Trump said that he was “not involved” in the Berman firing and that it was up to Barr. In something of a bind, Barr is allowing the SDNY deputy, an experienced prosecutor, to step into Berman’s role until the Senate can confirm a permanent replacement; Trump intends to nominate Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.One supposes that, eventually, Barr and Trump will get their stories straightened out. And Berman has now left, so the main goal has been achieved.But the real question is: Why? Why replace Berman now, just five months before the election?The answer lies in the firing earlier this year of Jessie Liu, the former U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. By firing Liu, Barr and his team took control of the Washington, D.C., U.S. attorney’s office. Until they did that, the office was following up on various indictments and charges that had been brought against Trump’s associates. Once they seized control, Barr’s team intervened to short-circuit that process. They interceded in the sentencing of Roger Stone, and more recently, they have made an effort to dismiss the case against Michael Flynn. In both circumstances, career prosecutors were so outraged that they withdrew from the case, and some resigned from the Department of Justice altogether.This is how an authoritarian works to subvert justice. He purports to uphold the forms of justice (in this case, the formal rule that the attorney general and the president exercise hierarchical control over the U.S. attorneys) while undermining the substance of justice. In the Flynn case, for example, Barr has asserted an absolute, unreviewable authority to bring and dismiss cases at will—a power that, even if legally well founded, is a subversion of justice when misused.That may be the game plan for New York as well. Barr may want Berman out so that he can use his newly enhanced control to dismiss or short-circuit all of the pending cases in Manhattan that implicate Trump or his associates.We know those are many. We know that Trump’s various organizations, including his inauguration committee, are under investigation. We know that Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani is under investigation. We know that Trump’s bank, Deutsche Bank, is under investigation.Since taking office, Barr has repeatedly intervened to protect Trump. In addition to the behavior already mentioned, we might identify his attempt to protect Trump’s tax records from disclosure, or the way he distorted the true contents of the Mueller report. Barr’s actions are more like those of a consigliere to Don Trump than those of an attorney general of the United States, working for the American people.Even that characterization is too kind to Barr. The attorney general’s apparent goal is to turn the Department of Justice into an arm of the president’s personal interests. He seems to have no regard for the department’s independence, and is doing long-term damage to the fabric of American justice.Given the authoritarian structure of what Barr is attempting to achieve—preserving the forms of liberty while destroying their substantive content—we might call this the Orbánification of the American system of governance. Like strongmen everywhere, Barr (and Trump) seek to exalt their interests over those of the nation. And this latest effort—seemingly to short-circuit the ongoing criminal investigation of Trump’s affiliates and associates—is only the most recent evidence. As he continues down this road, Barr is doing his best to make John Mitchell, President Richard Nixon’s disgraced attorney general, look like a man of principle.<br/><br/>
<a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2020/06/three-degrees-racism-america/613333/?utm_source=feed'>The Difference Between First-Degree Racism and Third-Degree Racism</a><br/><br/>
The unrelenting protests, the supportive statements from white leaders nationwide, and the early momentum behind policing policy changes are all indications that this might be a turning point in our nation’s battle against racism. Will we seize this opportunity or will we lose momentum, showing once again that America can be “a 10-day nation” that moves on too easily to the next crisis, as Martin Luther King Jr. warned a fellow civil-rights activist in 1963?My father, Emmett Rice, and I had hundreds of conversations about race and racism from the time I was a boy until a few weeks before he died, in 2011, at 91 years old. He was the most intellectually curious person I have ever known. He grew up in South Carolina in the Jim Crow era of the 1920s and ’30s. Despite losing his father when he was only 7, he graduated from college, served in World War II with the Tuskegee Airmen, earned a doctorate in economics, and became one of the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board in the 1980s. Racism still chased him and burdened him every day of his life. So he armed me with the knowledge he’d amassed, in hopes I could do even more.Thirty years ago, my dad gave me his playbook to put racism to rest, and it inspired me to dedicate my career to executing his vision. Dad’s playbook included one insight that all Americans should hear, at least those who hope that when it comes to addressing racism, we can do better. As an economist, he told me that we have to “increase the cost of racist behavior.” Doing so, he said, would create the conditions for black people to harness the economic power essential to changing the narrative in white America’s mind about race.[Read: History will judge the complicit]We can ratchet up that cost in several ways, starting today. The first step is to clarify what constitutes racist behavior. Defining it makes denying it or calling it something else that much harder. There are few things that white Americans fear more than being exposed as racist, especially when their white peers can’t afford to come to their defense. To be outed as a racist is to be convicted of America’s highest moral crime. Once we align on what racist behavior looks like, we can make those behaviors costly.The most well-understood dimension involves taking actions that people of color view as overtly prejudiced—policing black citizens much differently than whites, calling the police on a black bird-watcher in Central Park who is asking you to obey the law, calling somebody the N-word to show them who is boss. This is racism in the first degree. If officers anticipated that they would be held fully accountable for bad policing, they would do more good policing and we could begin healing the wounds they’ve inflicted on black people for centuries.Then there is opposing or turning one’s back on anti-racism efforts, often justified by the demonization of the people courageously tackling racist behavior. I call this racism in the second degree, akin to aiding and abetting. George Floyd’s death under yet another police officer’s knee exposed the NFL’s four-year effort to avoid confronting racist policing by way of demonizing Colin Kaepernick. When the NFL’s sponsors could no longer stay silent and its star players (both black and white) spoke out, the costs were so high that the commissioner felt compelled to apologize—though notably not to Kaepernick himself.[Jemele Hill: Suddenly the NFL cares about black lives]The final, most pernicious category undergirds the everyday black experience. When employers, educational institutions, and governmental entities do not unwind practices that disadvantage people of color in the competition with whites for economic and career mobility, that is fundamentally racist—not to mention cancerous to our economy and inconsistent with the American dream. For example, the majority of white executives operate as if there is a tension between increasing racial diversity and maintaining the excellence-based “meritocracies” that have made their organizations successful. After all, who in their right mind would argue against the concept of meritocracy?When these executives are challenged on hiring practices, their first excuse is always “The pipeline of qualified candidates is too small, so we can only do so much right now.” Over the past 20 years, I have not once heard an executive follow up the “pipeline is too small” defense with a quantitative analysis of that pipeline. This argument is lazy and inaccurate, and it attempts to shift the responsibility to fix an institution’s problem onto black people and the organizations working to advance people of color. When asked why they have so few minorities in senior leadership roles, executives’ most common response is “There are challenges with performance and retention.” To reinforce their meritocracy narrative, white leaders point to the few black people they know who have made it to the top, concluding inaccurately that they were smarter and worked harder than the rest.Organizations cannot be meritocracies if their small number of black employees spend a third of their mental bandwidth in every meeting of every day distracted by questions of race and outcomes. Why are there not more people like me? Am I being treated differently? Do my white colleagues view me as less capable? Am I actually less capable? Will my mistakes reflect negatively on other black people in my firm? These questions detract from our energy to compete for promotions with white peers who have never spent a moment distracted in this way. I wager that 90 percent of the white executives who read these last sentences are now asking, particularly after recent events, “How did we miss that?” This dimension of racism is particularly hard to root out, because many of our most enlightened white leaders do not even realize what they are doing. This is racism in the third degree, akin to involuntary manslaughter: We are not trying to hurt anyone, but we create the conditions that shatter somebody else’s future aspirations. Eliminating third-degree racism is the catalyst to expanding economic power for people of color, so it merits focus at the most senior levels of education, government, and business.Employers whose efforts to increase diversity lack the same analytical and executional rigor that is taken for granted in every other part of their business engage in practices that disadvantage black people in the competition for economic opportunity. By default, this behavior protects white people’s positions of power. The nonprofit organization that I have built over the past 20 years, Management Leadership for Tomorrow, has advanced more than 8,000 students and professionals of color toward leadership positions, and we partner with more than 120 of the most aspirational employers to support their diversity strategy, as well as their recruiting and advancement efforts. Yet I have not seen 10 diversity plans that have the foundational elements that organizations require everywhere else: a fact-based diagnosis of the underlying problems, quantifiable goals, prioritized areas for investment, interim progress metrics, and clear accountability for execution. Expanding diversity is not what compromises excellence; instead, it is our current approach to diversity that compromises excellence and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.We can increase the cost of this behavior by calling on major employers to sign on to basic practices that demonstrate that black lives matter to them. These include: (1) acknowledging what constitutes third-degree racism so there is no hiding behind a lack of understanding or fuzzy math, (2) committing to developing and executing diversity plans that meet a carefully considered and externally defined standard of rigor, and (3) delivering outcomes in which the people of color have the same opportunities to advance.[Read: To be black in America is to stare into the mirror of your own extinction]Companies that sign on will be recognized and celebrated. Senior management teams that decline to take these basic steps will no longer be able to hide, and they will struggle to recruit and retain top talent of all colors who will prefer firms that have signed on. The economic and reputational costs will increase enough for behavior and rhetoric to change. Then more people of color will become economically mobile, organizations will become more diverse and competitive, and there will be a critical mass of black leaders whose institutional influence leads to more racially equitable behavior. These leaders will also have the economic power to further elevate the cost of all other types of racist behavior, in policing, criminal justice, housing, K–12 education, and health care—systems that for decades have been putting knees on the necks of our most vulnerable citizens and communities.Third-degree racism can be deadly. For at least the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mandated that in order to get tested, you had to go to a primary-care doctor to get a prescription and then, in some areas, also get a referral to a specialist who could approve a test, because they were in limited supply. That process made it much harder for minorities to access tests, because they are much less likely to have  primary-care physicians. This is one of several reasons the hospitalization and death rates for minorities are disproportionately higher than those for whites. If the people who designed that process knew up front that they would be exposed as racist, fired, and ostracized if their approach put minorities at a greater health risk than white people, they would have designed it differently and saved black lives. Just having a critical mass of minorities in decision-making roles regarding that test-qualification process would have also saved many lives.Rooting out third-degree racism is what will ultimately change the narrative about race. When white people see more black people on the same path as they are, when white people are working in diverse organizations, and when they are proximate to black leaders beyond athletes and entertainers, only then will they stop fearing and feeling superior to the black people they don’t know.This is the path that will finally lift racism’s enormous burden off the backs of black people—the burden that my dad spent his nine decades working to shed, and that he hoped to avoid passing down to me, and that I am trying not to pass down to my 18-year old son as he graduates from high school and moves away. But if I am fortunate enough to someday have a grandson, and if he can grow up in a world where he can dedicate his full energy to becoming the best American he can be—as white people have been doing for 400 years—then my dad, so many other black fathers, and maybe even George Floyd will be able to rest in peace.<br/><br/>

“Your writing has punch, David. Punch is power!”After all these years, this simple message, my first words of true validation as a fledgling writer, has never left me. It echoes in my mind like a long canyon scream each time I sit down to a blank page, and inspires me to fill it with my true voice. After a childhood of failed classes and dismal report cards (most of which ended with comments such as, “David has potential, but his hyperactivity and attention-seeking behavior are a constant distraction to the class!”), it was if I had pulled the proverbial red pen from the stone. No small victory for the delinquent son of a public-school teacher, but let’s be honest, I was never destined to become the next Bill Shakespeare (ask any of my traumatized English teachers). It only makes sense that this particular validation wasn’t given by any of the poor, frustrated educators I left in my wake. No, it came from a truly brilliant writer who shaped my love (and fear) of the written word. The man, the myth, the legend … my father, James Harper Grohl.Born to a blue-collar, Ohioan steelworking family in 1938, my father was a complicated man of many, sometimes-conflicting layers. Actor, writer, award-winning journalist, lover of art and food, and a ferocious, classically trained musician. A true Renaissance man, yet so conservative that he would sometimes be mistaken in public for the legendary political commentator George Will. All this and more, poured into a crisp, clean seersucker suit.  James Grohl, pictured here with Nancy Reagan at the White House in the 1980s, worked as a national political reporter for Scripps-Howard News Network, and later as a political consultant. (Courtesy Dave Grohl)At night, you could find him reclined in his Eames chair with a glass of Johnnie Walker Red, baton in hand, listening to jazz records as the smoke of his sweet pipe wafted through his Alexandria, Virginia, apartment. But from 9 to 5, the dude made Ronald Reagan look like Abbie Hoffman. Cool as a cucumber, he could turn on the charm and work any Republican Capitol Hill shindig like he was to the manor born. Still, for all his starched shirts and Brooks Brothers socks, a beatnik was trapped somewhere deep within that perfectly tailored tuxedo, just screaming to come out. (He once very proudly bragged to me that the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg had hit on him at a party. Cutest-couple alert!)  How far does the apple fall from the tree? In my case, it not only ripped off the branch; it rolled all the way down the fuckin’ hill. Imagine Charles Schulz’s Pig-Pen moving in with Mr. Clean, and you’re getting warm. The Odd Couple on acid … I mean, you can’t really blame the guy for feeling terminally frustrated throughout my adolescent years. I’ve had feral pets that were easier to tame than me in my prepubescence. To put it mildly, Dad and I just didn’t see eye to eye. Nevertheless, DNA is a funny thing, and I don’t need a 23andMe kit to prove that my genetic code is candied with some of his more paradoxical qualities. And no matter how hard I tried to rebel, his hand always seemed to focus the lens through which I see the world (blurred as it may be). Beyond all our differences, if there is one gene that I am most thankful for, it is the one that fueled my love of music. A love that long ago inspired me to give my father his first taste of my literary prowess: a runaway note I left on his dining-room table in 1985.By then, I was a full-fledged, hardcore punk-rock teenager. I had taken the hereditary generosity of my father’s musical abilities and mutated them into the antithesis of his classically trained ear. I was the garage band to his conservatory, the screeching feedback to his perfect pitch, the Dead Kennedys to his Leonard Bernstein. We may have shared the same passion for music, but eventually I swapped his trademark baton and Eames chair for my splintered drumsticks and leather jackets. Steeped in the DIY culture of underground, independent music, I wanted nothing to do with the convention and formalities of becoming a classical musician. I wanted noise. I wanted chaos. I wanted the sweat and grime of a crowded gig on a Saturday night, covered in bruises from slam dancing along to my favorite band. I wanted to scream my voice hoarse, break every drumhead, and celebrate the disregard of “proper” technique. I wanted maximum rock and roll.[Read: The irreplaceable thrill of the rock show]At the time, I was in a band with a ragtag group of other misfits, suburban teens by the name of Mission Impossible. (Don’t laugh, but we often opened our shows with the nerdy theme song from the classic 1960s TV series. Actually, go ahead and laugh—it was ridiculous.) Fueled by our love of American hardcore music (and near-toxic amounts of Mountain Dew), we were like gnats with amplifiers. Among us, we had enough teenage angst and energy to support every major metropolitan power grid from Vegas to Virginia Beach. Furious tempos driven by raging attention-deficit disorders, any song in our repertoire that lasted more than three minutes we considered a virtual “Bohemian Rhapsody.” A blur of ripped jeans and Vans sneakers, we were following the path that our heroes had laid before us. And growing up on the outskirts of one of America’s most thriving punk-rock scenes, Washington, D.C., our heroes just happened to be the local bands that we could see every weekend. Minor Threat, Faith, Void, Government Issue, Bad Brains, Rites of Spring, just to name a few. These were bands that existed entirely outside the conventional, corporate music industry. They did it all themselves. So we did too.The author, pictured before his transformation into a Mountain-Dew-soaked blur of ripped jeans and Vans. (Courtesy Dave Grohl)Having been to countless shows at various community centers, art galleries, Knights of Columbus halls, and other “alternative” venues that actually allowed these types of raucous gatherings, I marveled at what appeared to be the simple method of promoting a punk-rock show: Find a place to play, fork over a security deposit, find some bands and a PA system, plaster handmade, xeroxed flyers on every telephone pole within walking distance of a cool record store, and pray that enough people would show up so that you wouldn’t be run out of town by an angry mob of debt collectors. Heck, I could do that! All I’d have to do is mow some lawns, pick up an odd job here and there, hawk some gear, and I could become the next Bill Graham! My mind was set, and I soon decided to try my hand at promoting a show all by myself. As with most achievements in my life, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing; I just followed my gut and hoped for the best. What could possibly go wrong? (Altamont, anyone?)Determined, I put my plan in motion and found a suitable venue. A rather nondescript, sterile community center in Bethesda, Maryland, just across the state line. It was no CBGB, but who else was going to trust their property to a 16-year-old kid in a beat-up Ford Fiesta? It had a stage, some lights, and a room big enough to hold maybe a hundred pent-up teenagers just like me. As far as I was concerned, I was well on my way to turning this bingo hall into motherfucking Madison Square Garden! Once I had convinced the staff that I was planning nothing more than a battle of the bands, next came the daunting task of finding a cheap PA system and a few other groups to round out the bill. A few phone calls, a few favors, and all systems were go. A date was set. My own personal lemonade stand from hell. The countdown began …Now, truth be told, I wasn’t technically “allowed” to be in a band at this time. Unfortunately, my grades had fallen to the point that my father had restricted me from playing any music with my friends, the one thing that I loved most in life. Old James believed that music was the thing keeping me from my studies, obviously. How dare he! I thought. I had finally found my voice, my identity, my tribe, only to have it all cruelly pulled out from under me on account of another disastrous report card. (Fuck biology!) I was beyond devastated. A seriously low blow that burned me from the inside out. Nevertheless, being the quintessential stubborn Capricorn that I am, his ruling only strengthened my resolve. No drum set? I practiced for hours on the pillows in my bedroom. No band rehearsal? I would rehearse the songs in my head as I made my 30-minute walk to school each day, memorizing arrangements as I played every drum part with my teeth. (Yes, I can play the drums with my teeth, just ask my horrified dentist.) Nothing could keep me from doing what my body and soul commanded—no, demanded. Restriction or not, I was going to find a way to fulfill my insatiable need to play music as if my life depended on it. Because it did.[Read: Dave Grohl’s pandemic playlist]I now woke up every morning with a newfound sense of purpose. I had finally found a reason to be. A chance to prove myself to the world. For once, my mind was laser-focused on realizing one solitary goal. (This was not the case in most other areas of my life, believe me.) My heart was inflated with a feeling that I had yet to find in life: the feeling of worth. Being in charge of something. Feeling like I could actually be who I wanted to be. These were the same emotions and ideas that filled the songs I sang along to every Saturday night in those sweaty nightclubs, so it only made sense that I was compelled to apply them to my own life and follow a path outside convention. If only I had applied that same energy and focus to dissecting frogs in biology class! I could have become the next Charles Darwin! But as far as I was concerned, blood and guts belonged on the stage, not under the cold, fluorescent lights of a schoolroom laboratory.The gig itself remains a bit of a blur, but I fortunately managed to escape without having to file Chapter 11 in juvenile court. Better yet, the security guy I was required to hire must not have enjoyed our particular style of “music” (a most generous term) and took off without getting paid the 50 bucks he was owed! So, with that wrinkled cash in hand, my bandmates and I retreated like bandits with a few pizzas to celebrate our lofty accomplishments. I passed out in a pile of greasy cardboard boxes, relishing in my sweet, adolescent victory.I remember hearing my father’s footsteps as he came through the front door the next morning. “Where's David?” his voice bellowed. Still in bed, I knew I was dead meat. Though he had no idea about the night before, I dreaded the undoubtedly harsh repercussions of him finding out about my forbidden, secret operation. My feeling of accomplishment quickly vanished, as did my newfound sense of purpose and identity that had filled me with so much pride. I fucked up, I thought. I got cocky. I should have just stayed home, stayed in my lane, played by the rules, fallen in line, and conformed to the “norm” like everyone else. Like my father had done. What was I thinking? My bedroom door opened, and my backpack was thrown into my lap with the words “Get dressed, let’s go.”The long, silent drive to my father’s apartment was suffocating. My mind went from remorse and regret to anger, frustration, and revenge. From my highest high to my lowest low in a mere 24 hours. I wanted to explode from the strafing of conflicting emotions I was experiencing. My dreams had been shattered, and I was now reduced to being just another high-school failure with nothing but a dismal life in a dead-end rat race to look forward to. That was everything I railed against. That was my greatest fear. Arriving at the apartment, I was instructed to study alone until dinner. As I sat there at his cluttered desk, books open, pen in hand, my mind was reeling. It was time to take a stand, I thought. I was not destined or designed to live a life of starched shirts and penny loafers. It was time to fight back.The dreaded “What do you want to do with your life?” lecture followed soon after dinner. A searing prosecution to which I had little defense. I was broken down and reduced to rubble, lowering my head in shame as my father delivered my sentence from his Eames chair. The verdict: a lifetime of mediocrity and squalor. It had become painfully clear to him that I did not want to follow in his footsteps, a bitter pill for any parent to swallow, so in his mind I was left with a hopeless existence as a failure. To him, my dreams were just dreams. Nothing more than fleeting illusions that fade away without a trace.To his credit, I now understand his concern. As the father of three amazing children of my own (all musically inclined), nothing is more important to me than their safety and well-being. My life duty now is to ensure that they're prepared to take on the world the day they decide to step out and make it their own. I wasn’t on the fast track to becoming a professional musician by any means, and having actually tried his hand at a career in music, my dad knew that the odds of success were minuscule. Especially considering the type of music my heart had chosen to play. Dissonant, antiestablishment thrash? Not a lot of Brooks Brothers socks in my future, even if I had wanted to wear them. But that made no difference to me. I needed music like air. Like food. Like water. Without it, I was just another kid, searching to belong.So that night, I waited for him to go to sleep, and I grabbed a (red) pen and a pad of paper. My hand pressed hard as I delivered my searing rebuttal, unleashing 16 years of fury as my tears hit the page in blurred stains. I rejected his narrow-minded life coaching and chastised him for his lack of faith in me, proudly confessing to my whereabouts the night before as an example of my capabilities. The line was now drawn. Don’t fuck with me. I quietly placed the note on the dining-room table, grabbed my backpack, and left. As the door closed behind me, so did a painful chapter in my life. A new, brighter chapter was about to begin. One in which I would never think of myself as a stupid fuckup destined to a life of mediocrity and squalor. I knew deep down that I was better than that. I turned and took one last look at the number plate on the door: Apartment 606.And the apple rolled a bit farther away.When does a boy become a man? Is there a particular moment of liberation from the age-old father-son conflict that can define such a profound transition? Some sort of metamorphosis, when the boy emerges from the chrysalis of adolescence, stepping out into the world to make it his own? Perhaps it’s the moment when the apple grinds to a halt at the bottom of the hill.My father read my letter. He felt the “punch” in my words. The next day, he called and only said, “Don’t ever do that again, David.” Fortunately, I never had to, because from that moment on he recognized that I knew in my heart who I was and who I wanted to be, and that nothing could stop me from becoming that person no matter what.[Read: E. B. White’s lesson for debut writers: It’s okay to start small]From that day forward, my father and I formed a new dynamic in our relationship, and over the years we developed a friendship based on mutual respect. It was if I had stepped out of his shadow, and my love for him was now allowed to grow. I learned to appreciate his wonderful eccentricities and puzzling idiosyncrasies (finding glimpses of myself in more than a few of them) and reconciled many of our past differences. As the years passed and my dreams of becoming a musician came true, he was always there to impart little gems of insight and wisdom, often steering me clear of the clichéd occupational hazards that typically clutter life in the music business. Now, rather than delivering imposing lectures from his dreaded Eames chair, he spun yarns of his childhood in Ohio, or of his time as a reporter in D.C. in the ’70s during Watergate, or of his years in Stuttgart serving in the Army. Take it from me, the guy knew how to tell a story. And with the advent of email, my dad and I struck up a most amusing correspondence of anecdotes and quips that ricocheted off one another like two skinny swords in a fencing match. Who else would send me an email beginning with “To writ” or containing words like redolent? He was endlessly entertaining and, without realizing it, inadvertently shaping my sense of composition and prose while quickly becoming my favorite read.During the pandemic lockdown, when I’ve had more than what I can generally tolerate of “downtime,” I’ve focused on a newfound pleasure in writing, telling various tales from my life. As I go over them from my own dreaded Eames chair with the proverbial red pen I inherited, I can’t help but think of my father, the journalist and master wordsmith. My father was my first, and best, reader. It was through him that I found my love of writing, filling me with the same sense of purpose and accomplishment that I felt that night at the Bethesda Community Center as a rebellious teen. So much that I’ve even contemplated trying my hand at writing a book someday. Imagine that. Just call it “kicking the apple back up the hill a bit.”If only he were still around to read it.<br/><br/>
<a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/06/how-negative-covid-19-test-can-mislead/613246/?utm_source=feed'>What a Negative COVID-19 Test Really Means</a><br/><br/>
You go out to a bar with friends this week, and you’re planning to visit your elderly relatives in a few days. You feel healthy, and you even get a COVID-19 test out of caution. The result comes back negative. Is it safe to go?Not exactly, experts say. How well COVID-19 tests work in people who feel healthy is still a key unknown of the pandemic. The test may overlook the small but growing amounts of virus in someone who has not yet developed symptoms, who could still go on to spread COVID-19 without knowing it. So as Americans weigh the risks of attending protests, rallies, birthday parties, dinners, and all the social gatherings that make up normal life, they will have to contend with the uncertainty that a negative test result does not rule out infection. “If they go do a risky contact, they can’t get a ‘Get out of jail free’ card. They can’t just get tested and feel fine,” A. Marm Kilpatrick, a disease ecologist at UC Santa Cruz, says.[Read: America is giving up on the pandemic]Understanding false negatives from COVID-19 tests is especially important because people who do not yet know that they’re sick play a major role in the spread of COVID-19. A study based on data in and around China suggests that 44 percent of transmission comes from presymptomatic cases. The United States has not isolated people who say they feel sick as aggressively as China has, so it likely has a higher proportion of symptomatic transmission, Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, who co-authored the study, says. But China’s experience makes clear that simply isolating people once they are sick is not enough. “We can’t ignore presymptomatic transmission,” Cowling says. “Even if you manage to stop some of the transmission from going on by doing isolation cases, you still will have this presymptomatic transmission, which keeps the epidemic going.”It’s still unclear how good COVID-19 tests are at finding these presymptomatic cases, but the timing of the test matters. As soon as the coronavirus finds its way into a new host, it hijacks cells to copy itself. The amount of virus builds over this time, peaking at or right before symptom onset, which can take two to 14 days but usually takes an average of five or six. Accordingly, public-health authorities have advised getting tested about four days after exposure.[Read: The protests will spread the coronavirus]This is a reasonable recommendation, given the knowns, but surprisingly little data exists on how early COVID-19 tests can detect infection before symptom onset. One model using COVID-19 cases from seven previously published studies suggests that the false-negative rate is 100 percent on day one of exposure, which falls to 38 percent on day five (when symptoms on average appear) and then a minimum of 20 percent on day eight. But in combing the literature, the researchers behind this model found only one case where a patient was tested before feeling sick—as part of a cluster at a chalet in the French Alps. Moreover, the model doesn’t address a whole other set of people who never develop symptoms at all. “It gave no information about people who are permanently asymptomatic,” Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who co-authored that study, told me.More data are likely to come soon. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration released recommendations for labs and manufacturers that want to validate COVID-19 tests in people who don’t have symptoms. (Currently, no tests are FDA-authorized for screening asymptomatic people.) Testing large numbers of asymptomatic people—such as by pooling samples—to identify potential silent carriers will also be an essential part of the reopening strategy for schools and businesses.[Read: COVID-19 can last for several months]For individuals, however, the FDA cautions that negative results do not rule out infection. It asks that asymptomatic tests include this statement: “Negative results must be considered in the context of an individual’s recent exposures, history, presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with COVID-19.” And this, in the face of imperfect COVID-19 tests, is key to interpreting a negative result. It depends on your probability of having COVID-19 in the first place.Consider again the decision to visit elderly relatives after a negative test. “If you have symptoms or you work in a place where you’re at high risk for exposure, then even with a negative test, you might want to think really hard about it,” Steven Woloshin, a co-director of the Center for Medicine and Media at the Dartmouth Institute, explained to me. “If you’re at low risk because you live in some remote area, you’re practicing social distancing, you always wear a mask, and you feel fine,” a negative test is probably a true negative. So even with widespread testing, social distancing and masks will continue to be important for controlling the spread of COVID-19.<br/><br/>
<a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/lauren-groff-kent-russell-florida/612259/?utm_source=feed'>The Dark Soul of the Sunshine State</a><br/><br/>
Marta MonteiroFlorida! Surreal state, plastic state, state of swamp and glitz, state as object of the lust and ridicule of the other 49, state dangling off the body of the continent like—well!—a hanging chad. Seek to encapsulate Florida in a single narrative, and you’ll find yourself thwarted. What is normal in the backwoods of the panhandle or on the prairies of north-central Florida is ludicrously alien in Miami Beach. Even the stories that have lured the majority of Floridians to this place are largely empty promises, gusts of devilishly hot and humid air. Because most of us have come from elsewhere, including me, and because the state is a mishmash of unintegrated and wildly different peoples and cities, we have no deep, shared mythologies. We find our motley self-portrait composed of stories that shift like sand underfoot, without a single solid base to keep us standing (unless we count the inane violence of college football, which, oh please, let’s not).To try to understand this most incomprehensible state, we need varied and probing narratives, ones that change as Florida changes and are told by people who love the state too deeply to refrain from blistering criticism. Into this role steps the native South Floridian memoirist Kent Russell with his sharp, brilliant, mean, and exasperating hybrid book, In the Land of Good Living. By exasperating, I mean that I’ve never read an account of our gorgeous and messed-up state that is a more appropriate match of form and function. Russell’s book is a braid of diverse strands that shouldn’t work together and yet do.The conceit of his memoir is a road trip taken with two of his friends as they walk more than 1,000 miles from the northwest corner of the panhandle south to Miami’s Coconut Grove, from late August to December of 2016. They were inspired by former Governor “Walkin’ Lawton” Chiles, who launched his national political career in 1970 with a “walking-talking and listening campaign.” Their intention is “elegiac,” to assemble “the last, most comprehensive postcards from Florida as we know her. Before she takes the waters”—in other words, before climate change destroys many parts of the state.The three men are trying to make a film, and because their trek takes place during the run-up to and weeks after the 2016 presidential election, they discover that swing-state Florida is the best place in the country in which to trace America’s political divisions. The first-person speaker among the three (anti?)heroes is our author, Kent, a “paunchy nebbish,” a Columbia University adjunct instructor with a mullet grown for the trip, who is most eloquent when he is either at his bitterest or most intoxicated by booze or drugs. His friends are Noah, a former marine turned client investigator at JPMorgan Chase, who is given the best punch lines in the book, and Glenn, the cameraman, a “blond, blue-eyed, dad-bodied” Canadian whose optimism is slowly infected by the reality of Florida until he becomes, by the end of the journey, hilariously bleak.The spirit of Don Quixote presides over this buddy-trip plotline. Florida is so deeply quixotic that it probably does require three separate Sancho Panzas to refract its delusions. There are even multiple versions of Rocinante, Quixote’s placid, bony horse: first an Office Depot cart with a mean torque, christened “Rolling Thunder,” which carries the film gear and Kent’s backpack; then a Victorian-esque baby carriage called “Rock-a-bye Thunder”; then a jogging stroller called “Jog-a-bye Thunder.” Like Sancho Panza, our three errant philosophers are sometimes reluctant, sometimes avid participants in their adventures. They go out on a shrimping boat with Trump supporters. Homeless people and alligators beset the friends’ tents in the night. At one point, they accidentally pawn their equipment for cocaine. They have multiple guns pointed at them on their journey, the first by a woman who thinks they’ve got “some IED-looking thing” in their cart. Their feet disintegrate over the many miles. They get trashed on White Russians during a false-alarm hurricane, and get even more trashed at Epcot with an aspiring Jesus who unofficially performs miracles at the Holy Land Experience theme park. They get lap dances in Tampa. They devolve into fisticuffs among themselves like the overgrown, overprivileged, overeducated white boys they are.Because the book is about the film that the men are making, many of the scenes between the buddies are written as though they are in a screenplay; these parts are funny and charming and, perhaps weirdly in a nonfiction book, have the distinctive tang of fiction. Or perhaps this is appropriate: As Russell says in a closing author’s note, “This book is about Florida. To write a 100 percent factual book about Florida would be like writing an on-the-level guide to fraud … The preceding is as Florida as can be: the real story built upon the true story.” Throughout, Russell gives us the accepted story of Florida, then the actual—far darker—story.[Read: Lauren Groff's ‘Florida’ is full of dreadful beauty]That old canard about Ponce de León finding Florida while looking for the fountain of youth? It’s a lie; de León stumbled upon the place in 1513 when looking for a better one, and, years later, when he tried to colonize the area for the Spanish, he was killed by the Calusa with an arrow dipped in poisonous manchineel sap. Russell excels at such delightful nutshell histories, many of which involve a measure of both peril and con-artistry. The backstories of air-conditioning, hurricanes, orange cultivation, Walt Disney, and Miami, in Russell’s telling, all feature some element of wildly ambitious delusion and/or a hair’s-breadth escape from disaster.Russell is at his best when he offers cultural commentary, dropping his gonzo persona and becoming wickedly insightful. He looks hard at the libertarian funk found everywhere in Florida, which can confound residents and outsiders alike. Russell quotes the historian Gary Mormino’s observation that “frontier values—fierce individualism, gun violence, a weak state government, and rapacious attitudes toward the environment—defined and continue to define Florida.” This is true even of the liberal Baby Boomers who keep flocking to the state, and who pride themselves on their nonconformity and resistance to authority, which they see as progressive values. But their stance in fact converges with an aggressive conservatism, marked by its attack-dog insistence on elevating the rights of individuals to do whatever the hell they want, society at large and the environment be damned. In Florida, Russell observes, “liberty” is equated with “license,” in contrast to more noble past visions of liberty as “not the absence of constraint, but the exercise of self-limitation.”[Read: The ‘Slave Power’ behind Florida’s felon disenfranchisement]This unrestrained mentality pervades retirement utopias like the Villages, where 66,000-plus “active adults” over the age of 55 live in a “plastic antiplace” that they don’t really have to care about. Because their hearts are back where they’re from—Cincinnati or Minneapolis or Albany—they are unwilling to invest in Florida schools and roads and public services; the state is just a place to let a little sun shine down on their heads, to play a few rounds of golf while they’re awaiting death’s sickle. Their particular brand of confused libertarianism intermingles with the more common flavor Russell and his friends encounter on their trip. Nearly everywhere they go, they find Trump supporters (most devastating, even a climate scientist they meet is a Trump apologist). He writes, sympathetically, that these people belong toa class that has been told time and again that they are exceptionally free. Free to fashion their social and economic identities howsoever they choose. Free to master their fates and captain their souls. Yet everywhere they turn, these individuals are stymied by political and financial powers from whose vantage they appear to be as abstract and insignificant as remainders on a spreadsheet. There is a growing discrepancy between [their] right to self-assertion and [their] capacity to control the forces that might make such self-assertion feasible.Russell’s most painful observation, the one that struck me where I live, is that the con men in politics who are able to capture the imaginations of these lied-to, thwarted people rely upon tropes that were first promulgated in the academy.Call it what you like—relativism, postmodernism, deconstruction. The lesson is one and the same: The truth is not out there waiting to be objectively uncovered. The truth is made. Facts are fabricated as seen fit by the powers that be, and then consent for those facts is manufactured, enforced.The idiot children born of Derrida and Foucault are alternative facts, fake news.What undergirds Russell’s narrative of Florida is despair as invisible, dark, and pervasive as the limestone bedrock that sits beneath the state. To me, this feels like both the real and the true story of Florida. In recent years, the diminishment of the aquifer through climate change and agricultural use, the slow and terrifying death of the Everglades’ enormous filtration system, the pressure of salinated waters from the rising sea, the stupidly unconstrained construction and development are all creating an epidemic of sinkholes. When a sinkhole develops, the fragile karst suddenly gives way under the weight of the earth; in a moment, houses and cars and people are swallowed up.[Read: Why are there so many sinkholes in Florida?]I write this from the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a similarly collapsing effect on Florida. A huge number of the state’s jobs are in the service sector: tourism, restaurant work, elder care, the gig economy—the realm of employment that thrives more than any other on ideas of predatory short-term growth and lax worker protection. Disney World, that great burbling morass of capitalism, announced it would furlough more than 43,000 of its workers, a move whose effects will ripple into employees’ families, both here and abroad; into school systems and food banks; into the very lowest and most fundamental reaches of the social safety net. What a small wind it takes for hedonism to tip into precarity!This is not a flaw in the system. This has been, all along, the shifty, lying, scam-artist libertarian narrative at Florida’s core, from the conquistadores who trudged through the malarial swamps; to the Ponzi schemes of Gulf American, the real-estate company that sent flocks of salesmen to the Midwest and Northeast in the late 1950s to lure suckers into buying worthless plots of land in the swamp; to Walt Disney himself, who created an oligarchic capitalist microstate (like Satan’s Vatican) in the very heart of Florida; to the massive narcissistic baby in the White House who uses his Mar-a-Lago resort as a way to milk money out of patsies eager to buy influence.The state has been built on promises of an eternal present, on blithe and deliberate disregard for the past so as not to have to learn from it—on a refusal to give a single naked whit about the future. Like people who don’t protest their fleecing in order to watch other people be swindled, we continue to perpetuate this corrosive narrative. In most elections, Florida votes for precisely the people trying to strip necessary life-giving protections from our neighbors and from the glorious natural environment that we are dependent on. Which is to say, of course, that the story of Florida is a story, in microcosm, of the United States of America.Does this idea fill you with despondency? Does the thought of Florida make you want to laugh and cry at the same time? I, too, laugh at the capers of Florida Man, at the stupid beautiful bodies of sun-blistered spring-breakers, at the tourists who drunkenly wander too close to retention ponds and tempt the hunger of the gators. But if I’m laughing, it’s only through a quietly devastating despair. As Russell puts it in his hilarious gut punch of a book—a book that anyone who is interested in not only Florida, but the whole country, should read—“How long before a society of atomized individuals rightfully following only their desires, heedless of what they owe others, destroys itself?”This article appears in the July/August 2020 print edition with the headline “Florida, Man.”<br/><br/>

As lockdown measures start to be eased in most countries around the world, the experts of The Conversation’s global network have focused this week on the major trends that are reshaping trade and the global economy.
Just before the pandemic struck, the economy was already losing momentum. However, the crisis is unlikely to put a stop to globalisation: rather, coronavirus is the starting point for a reconfiguration of the global system. Value chains are shortening in some sectors, China is seeking to extend government control over its economy, and global consumption has been undermined by the recession in the US. 
Academics in our network analyse the impact of the pandemic on globalisation.

Reshuffling the deck

China’s international trade mapped: In order to understand the magnitude of the economic shock of the Covid-19 pandemic, Jun Du, Agelos Delis, Mustapha Douch and Oleksandr Shepotylo of Aston University mapped China’s recent trade. They showed that worst-affected Chinese imports are machinery and luxury goods. As for exports, goods whose production is labour-intensive, such as furniture, have fallen drastically, as well as capital goods such as nuclear reactors. According to these economists, these trends could be long-lasting, as most countries become aware of the fragility of global value chains – without, however, completely undermining globalisation.

Tensions between Australia and China: Richard Holden of the Unversity of New South Wales wonders about the new tensions over barley and the impact that the crisis could have on relations between the two countries.
Return of the local economy: Some countries, faced with the uncertainties of the future, prefer to turn to more local forms of economy. This is the case in Canada, particularly in the area of fisheries. Kristen Lowitt of Brandon University and Charles Z. Levkoe of Lakehead University have looked at policies in north-western Ontario trying to help local people to benefit more from the fish caught in the Thunder Bay area, which are generally destined for export.
Golden days are over: Before the pandemic, the global economy was already showing signs of fragility against the backdrop of trade tensions between China and the US. Countries had been building up their gold reserves, but then just before the COVID-19 pandemic, demand slowed. “In truth, this was not entirely surprising”, writes Drew Woodhouse (Sheffield Hallam University). “Purchasing bullion at close to a seven-year high, and after a month of prices fluctuating plus or minus about 13%, is no particularly prudent way to consolidate economic and geopolitical power.”

China’s recovery

Protection and control: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang gave a 55-minute speech at China’s National People’s Congress on May 22, which had been postponed for two months due to the pandemic, in which he outlined the government’s recovery strategy. He set out a roadmap, deciphered by Jane Duckett, Holly Snape, Hua Wang, Yingru Li (University of Glasgow), with two watchwords: “protection” and “control”. Li stressed that continued vigilance against the coronavirus will be a core thread determining everything from macro-level strategy down to micro-level policy for the foreseeable future in China.

Hard times

On your own: The economic crisis is hitting the US hard – tens of millions of Americans are now registering for unemployment as companies close and lay off workers. Despite the federal government’s efforts, people are unable to meet their immediate financial needs for food, care and shelter. As Paul Shafer (Boston University) details, the crisis reveals the major flaws in the American social safety net. 

Globally, the pandemic has also hit developing countries hard.

Food insecurity: Borja Santos Porras (IE University) is concerned about the poverty and food insecurity that the crisis is causing in low-income countries. They believe that these two factors could kill more people than the disease itself.


Pandemic poverty: In Indonesia, the poorest are also at the mercy of the virus. Fisca Miswari Aulia (BAPPENAS), Maliki (BAPPENAS) and M Niaz Asadullah (University of Malaya) estimate that an additional 3.6 million people could face poverty as a result of the pandemic.
Refugees struggling: In East Africa, it is the plight of refugees in Nairobi that interests Naohiko Omata (University of Oxford). He points out that these populations have very low incomes, most often generated by daily street sales, and are directly affected by the disease.

 Christine Roy/UnsplashThe management of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in tough public policy measures around the globe, including lockdowns aimed at reducing human interaction to a minimum. These measures, which have put a stop to big chunks of economic activity, have come with devastating consequences, forcing business to lay off tens of millions of workers globally.
To mitigate the social and economic impacts, governments have had to dig deep into their finances that in some instances were already under strain. These are over and above the resources that governments need to pump into their health systems as they battle the pandemic. This additional expenditure comes at a time when the shutdown of economic activity has reduced tax collection, placing further strain on the public purse.
The Conversation has brought together analyses of these issues by its network of experts. In this round up we pulled together some of the articles from the week that was. They cover national budgets in the time of COVID-19, how remote working is worsening inequality, the pandemic’s after-effects on inflation, rising unemployment, and the likelihood of a higher debt burden on future generations.

What various countries are doing
Governments have two options to finance additional expenditures: higher taxes and raising more debt.

Indonesia has decided to issue government bonds to finance a stimulus package to counter the impacts of COVID-19. Nurhastuty K. Wardhani explains that the long-term nature of the bond and its denomination in US dollars will most likely be a burden on future generations.
Argentina is seeking ways to tax its way out of the current economic crisis induced by COVID-19. Alejandro Milcíades Peña and Matt Barlow explain why this is risky for a country that already has very high tax rates.
New Zealand should unleash aggressive but well-targeted spending, says Ilan Noy. Without it, the burden of an L-shaped economic trajectory will be far greater on future generations than any debt governments might take on now to develop a vaccine or keep businesses afloat and people on payrolls. Norman Gemmell outlines what the country’s forthcoming budget should look like as the country prepares to come out of its COVID-19 lockdown.



A number of African countries face strained public finances, some already struggling to repay their debt. In response, there have been growing calls for debt relief. However, Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal argues that any proposed moratorium must involve lenders and investors to prevent unintended consequences that could be costly for Africa.
Canada is forecasting a twelve-fold increase in its budget deficit this financial year, driven by the sharp drop in forecasted tax collections and the government’s extraordinary spending measures to support the economy and manage the pandemic. However, as Patrck Lebland says, this may not result in higher taxes.

US unemployment shot up from 4.4% in March to 14.7% in April, but Jay L. Zagorsky says unemployment is not likely to reach 25%, the highest level reached during the 1933 depression. In his view, the crisis will be short-lived and the US economy will rebound when people resume their economic activities.
Australia‘s Reserve Bank has forecast overly optimistic economic growth and employment (one in 13 people in Australia will lose their jobs) for the next two years, according to Peter Martin. Drawing on what happened after the global financial crisis in 2008, he sees a recovery that looks more like a flat-bottomed boat. 

Meanwhile, Alan Shipman cautions about the dangers of a further decline on consumer price inflation. When consumers sense that prices are going to continue falling, they put off expenditure on non-essential purchases, hoping to pick them up later at an even lower price. Such behaviour obviously leads to a decline in consumer spending, one of the major drivers of economic activity.

Workplace and inequality

The office will change beyond the pandemic. Dave Cook outlines the five trends that will shape the workplace of the future.
Remote work can be a source of socioeconomic inequality, warn Ugo Lachapelle and Georges A. Tanguay. While the measure is aimed at slowing down the spread of the pandemic, the researchers analysed 2015 Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) data to show that the number of telecommuters increases with personal income. Jobs with a large share of low-income workers generally have few telecommuters and lose out on its benefits.

(Beth LaBerge/KQED via AP)This is the week the number of people infected with coronavirus worldwide officially exceeds two million. Since this figure only relates to detected cases, the real number is likely much higher.
The pandemic is ongoing, and while some countries begin confinement, others hope to ease it soon. At the same time, it is inevitable to think about how the world might change once this is all over, and if a return to “normality” is even possible.
This sixth weekly column by our team of international health editors summarises some of the recently published articles from The Conversation’s global network.







This is our weekly roundup of expert info about the Coronavirus.

Treatments, promises and risks
Developing treatments and vaccines against a disease takes years, often decades, but right now we do not have the luxury of time. To this end, many researchers are testing the effectiveness of old, already approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2. Some of the findings so far relate to:

The effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine. This controversial purported treatment for COVID-19, championed by Donald Trump, the US president, has had many doubts cast on its effectiveness. Katherine Seley-Radtke of the University of Maryland summarises the many questions raised by this antimalarial drug.
Antibodies in the blood of survivors. Our immune system is a powerful weapon against infection. Ann Sheehy of the College of the Holy Cross tells us how blood plasma from recovered patients could help fight coronavirus.
The importance of reducing risks. Social distancing is a fundamental measure to delay the advancement of coronavirus, but its success depends on understanding social interactions must be redefined. Catharine Chambers and Daniel Harris of the University of Toronto explain why we should not make exceptions or let our guard down.

Issues of race and gender
The pandemic is not affecting everyone equally. The effects of coronavirus differ greatly between different classes, races and genders. Our authors have covered:

How racism impacts health. Data is now available that indicates African Americans are suffering more severely during the epidemic. Roberta K Timothy of the University of Toronto explains the causes and proposes solutions.





Clinical trials not reaching Africa. There are over 150 ongoing clinical trials researching the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Only three are taking place in Africa, and all of them in Egypt. Jenniffer-Mabuka-Maroa, from the African Academy of Sciences, believes the continent has the necessary infrastructures to assist the research.
The consequences for women. Not only does confinement disproportionally affect the work/life balance of women generally, it raises many issues for women suffering domestic violence. María López Belloso, from the University of Deusto, Spain, defends (in Spanish) the incorporation of a gender perspective in the data and analysis of the pandemic.

Populism and dictatorship

The price of populism. Jonatan A Lassa and Miranda Booth, from Charles Darwin University (Australia), discuss the role populist leaders have had in the global failure to respond to COVID-19. Despite this, they fear those same leaders will be able to take advantage of this crisis.
The Ghanaian law against coronavirus. The government of Ghana has approved an act to combat the pandemic that opens the door to violations of human rights and freedoms. Kwadwo Appiagyei-Atua, from the University of Ghana, discusses the law, its problems and risks.

Past lessons

Advice from Nelson Mandela. The South African leader spent decades in a tiny cell, where he had to learn to keep his body active. Gavin Evans of Birkbeck, University of London explains how the Nobel Prize winner managed to keep his body and mind healthy thanks to a strict routine.
Parallels with the Spanish Civil War. Spain has not experienced a situation similar to the current one since the Civil War of 1936. In a similar fashion to today, volunteering and messages of consolation played an important role in overcoming the tragedy. Dolores Ruiz Berdún, from the University of Alcalá (Spain), explains the commonality between past and present (in Spanish).

Looking to the future

The Chinese economy needs the rest of the world. The pandemic is a global challenge, and no less for the world’s largest exporter. China struggles to regain lost ground, but it cannot do it alone. Rusli Abdulah of the Institute for the Development of the Economy and Finance (Indonesia) explains why.
Phasing back to ‘normality’. After more than a month of confinement in some countries, citizens are wondering when things will return the way they were. Ignacio López-Goñi, from the University of Navarra (Spain), explains the phased return to life as it was, and how to guarantee its success.

Questions and answers

Can mothers continue to breastfeed? Although the mortality of COVID-19 in children and babies is low compared to other ages, that does not mean that they cannot experience more severe symptoms. Andini Pramono, from the Australian National University, explains how to breastfeed safely in the midst of the pandemic.
What does “recovered” mean? Most coronavirus patients return to full health. So Tom Duszynski of Indiana University answers some questions about how our bodies fight the virus … and how the immune system prevents new infections.
What about the masks? Kieran Moore of Queen’s University, Ontario, answers the most frequently asked questions about SARS-CoV-2, such as the advisability of wearing face masks, the length of school closings and how long we can be infected before showing symptoms.

A hospital worker at a COVID-19 assessment centre for staff at Lions Gate Hospital, in North Vancouver, on March 19, 2020. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl DyckThe world shut down in March. Schools, industries, amateur and professional sports, entertainment and cultural events, and businesses large and small all ceased operating in a manner so sudden and complete it would have been unimaginable a few months ago.
April began with the acceptance that these efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 must continue. Millions of people were faced with the realities of having to pay bills, rent and mortgages despite layoffs and shuttered businesses. And on April 2, the pandemic itself passed a couple of grim milestones: more than one million confirmed infections and 50,000 deaths worldwide.

It is the health-care workers who are dealing head-on with the reality of those staggering global statistics. The rest of us can help control the numbers by staying at home and practising social distancing.
This fifth weekly column by our team of international health editors highlights more of the recently published articles from The Conversation’s global network.
Vulnerable heroes
In photos, front-line health-care workers are rendered anonymous by gowns, masks and gloves, like superheroes with secret identities but less glamorous costumes. Unlike their comic-book counterparts, they have no superpowers, not even the dependable tools of vaccines and evidence-based treatments. 
And they are frighteningly mortal — as vulnerable as the rest of us to the illness they’re trying to treat. 
● Shortage of masks. This makes the growing shortage of personal protective equipment a dire emergency, writes W. Graham Carlos of Indiana University School of Medicine.

● Shortage of ventilators. It’s also very likely that health-care workers will face difficult decisions about which patients get ventilators and intensive care beds. Anthony Wrigley of Keele University, England, explains the ethical choices involved in allocating resources in a crisis situation.
● Shortage of staff. With all hands on deck at hospitals, some facilities are encouraging people still in training or health-care workers from other jurisdictions to help out. However, as Nicole Blay of Western Sydney University and Christine Duffield and Michael Roche of University of Technology Sydney point out, we must be sure that those brought in to help cope with the pandemic are qualified to take on those tasks.

Their work will get harder in many places
The coronavirus continues to spread exponentially around the world, which means that as more people become infected, the virus spreads faster. 
● Speed of transmission. Christian Yates of the University of Bath, England, explains the math behind the virus’s exponential spread.  
● Examining Indonesia’s high mortality rate. In many regions, the worst is yet to come. While cases in the northern hemisphere are spiking, the first case in Indonesia was only diagnosed on March 2. Since then, the fatality rate in Indonesia has become the highest in Southeast Asia. However, Henry Surenda, of the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit, explains three reasons why that fatality rate does not reflect the reality on the ground.

● Unique issues in Africa. SARS-CoV-2 has arrived in Africa later than it did in Asia and Europe, just as SARS did in 2003 and H1N1 did in 2009. Elena Gomez Diaz, from the López-Neyra Institute of Parasitology and Biomedicine, and Israel Cruz Mata, of Instituto de Salud Carlos III, explain why the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa is so worrying (in Spanish).
● Testing decisions. Doyin Odubanjo, executive secretary of the Nigerian Academy of Science, explains why testing is central to the fight against COVID-19, and discusses some of the many factors African countries must consider when making decisions about how to approach testing.
● Who is at risk? Meanwhile, areas already hit hard by the virus are beginning to reckon with the losses. Jean-François Toussaint, from the Université de Paris, and Guillaume Saulière, of the Institut national du sport de l'expertise et de la performance, describe the toll of COVID-19 on vulnerable older populations (in French).
Treatment updates

● Vaccine development. The best way to combat the virus is a vaccine. Kylie Quinn, from RMIT University, and Damian Purcell, of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Melbourne, offer an update on the efforts to develop a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
● Chloroquine studies. In terms of treatments, there was hope that the malaria medication chloroquine might be a useful treatment for COVID-19. But as Arsène Zongo from the Université Laval, Canada, reports, published studies have not proven its effectiveness (in French). 
● Antiviral drugs. Vicente Soriano of Universidad Internacional de La Rioja writes about antiviral medications, which can shorten the duration and severity of symptoms (in Spanish).
Stay informed, stay home, stay six feet away
For the vast majority of us who are not researchers or health-care workers or providing essential services, the best way to help is to stay informed, stay home and stay two metres away from others.
● COVID-19 glossary. You can improve your understanding of what scientists, researchers and health-care workers are talking about with this handy cheat-sheet on coronavirus jargon, provided by Lindsay Broadbent of Queen’s University Belfast.

Many people are looking for practical information about the virus and how to prevent infection. The Conversation’s editors around the globe have recruited experts to answer many of those questions. 
● Social distancing rules. The Conversation team in Australia got answers about where people can and can’t go during social distancing from legal experts Brendan Gogarty at the University of Tasmania and Ros Vickers at Charles Darwin University.

● Coronavirus FAQs. Craig Janes, from the University of Waterloo, Canada, patiently answered a long list of questions about how to destroy the virus, how long it persists on surfaces and more.
● Sex and social distancing. But there was still one more question, and we weren’t afraid to ask. Here are the dos and don’ts of sex during social distancing, courtesy of Gonzalo R. Quintana Zunino at Concordia University, Canada.

<a href='https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-weekly-as-the-world-stays-at-home-where-is-the-pandemic-heading-135136'>Coronavirus weekly: as the world stays at home, where is the pandemic heading?</a><br/><br/>
From New York to Moscow, Johannesburg to Buenos Aires, the novel coronavirus continues its global journey. On March 30, almost three months after China announced the discovery of COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus, more than 780,000 people have been infected and at least 37,000 have died. 
While the epidemic appears to be under control in China, the US is now the country most affected by the pandemic. In Europe, it would appear containment measures and lockdowns are beginning to bear fruit: in Italy, the figures indicate a slowdown in the number of infections.
All over the world countries are locking themselves off one after the other, closing their borders and confining their populations more and more drastically. The World Health Organization has welcomed these efforts. The world is slowing down and holding its breath. For how long?
As researchers around the world continue to decipher the consequences of this unprecedented situation and to seek solutions to the crisis, The Conversation’s international network continues to work with them to inform you as best as possible.







This is our weekly roundup of expert info about the coronavirus.
The Conversation, a not-for-profit group, works with a wide range of academics across its global network. Together we produce evidence-based analysis and insights. The articles are free to read – there is no paywall – and to republish. Keep up to date with the latest research by reading our free newsletter.

The fate of the epidemic
How long will we have to live with COVID-19? Could it possibly return? The history and modelling of epidemics can help find the answers. 

Modelling past major epidemics can show how this one will unfold. This is what Adam Kleczkowski at the University of Strathclyde and Rowland Raymond Kao at the University of Edinburgh have done.




An example of a disease progress curve for a long-term scenario following the initial outbreak: quick eradication. The number of cases and duration of the epidemic for illustrative purpose only.



Mathematical models. Christian Yates at the University of Bath explains how epidemiologists create the models to predict the course of an epidemic, which are essential tools for informing governments’ actions.
Anticipating epidemics. According to Éric Muraille at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, history teaches us epidemics are inevitable. This is why it is essential to know how to anticipate them (in French).

The fate of the pandemic will obviously depend on the weapons at our disposal to fight the coronavirus.

Chloroquine? Parastou Donyai from the University of Reading explains that although much has been written about the anti-malarial drug, there is as yet no evidence of its effectiveness in preventing COVID-19.
Therapies and vaccines. Ignacio López-Goñi at the University of Navarra lists the different therapeutic trials currently underway and says there is hope for therapies to treat patients or vaccines to prevent infection. 

The coronavirus pandemic must not be allowed to overshadow other deadly diseases. 

Tuberculosis and AIDS. Emily Wong at the University of KwaZulu-Natal draws attention to the fact that in South Africa, COVID-19 is adding to existing epidemics. Experts are concerned these patients are more at risk of developing severe forms of the disease. 

A disease of biodiversity
Like many infectious diseases that affect humans, the COVID-19 pandemic is a zoonosis: the virus that comes from animals.

Bats? - Once again, this new virus probably originated from a bat. Eric Leroy at the Institut de recherche pour le développement explains why these mammals are a “usual suspect” for the transmission of viruses to humans (in French). 
But it’s unfair to blame them, because they do us important services and must be protected, says Peter Alagona at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

Rather than blaming these flying mammals, we’d be better off questioning our relationship to nature and biodiversity.

The symptom of a global environmental crisis? It could well be, write Philippe Grandcolas and Jean-Lou Justine at the Muséum national d’histoire naturelle (MNHN) (in French)
“This is not a tragedy for everyone. Some of our neighbours are doing better since we have retired to our apartments”, writes Jérôme Sueur at MNHN. Less human activity means less noise, which is actually a good thing for birds in our cities, in particular (in French).

Lockdown left behind
More and more of us are being confined in the hope of limiting the spread of the virus and relieving the unbearable strain on health systems. But not everyone is equal when it comes to lockdown and quarantine measures. Some groups are particular at risk.

Elderly or disabled people. In medical-social institutions, those who are already vulnerable are the big losers of containment measures, writes Emmanuelle Fillion at École des hautes études en santé publique (in French).
Prisoners. (in French) This is also the case of prisoners, whose fate worries the prison administration because of their proximity to the prison. 
Those who can’t be confined. Alex Broadbent and Benjamin Smart at the University of Johannesburg point out that some cannot be locked down, or even implement adequate social distancing measures.

In addition to the risk of lockdown, heads of state face political risk: their every move is scrutinised and commented upon.

The South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is no exception, explains Richard Calland at the University of Cape Town, but so far his government’s lockdown measures seem adequate, writes Philip Machanick at Rhodes University.
Conversely, as the epidemic is just entering a phase of exponential growth in Indonesia, Iqbal Elyazar at the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit and his colleagues are urging the government to take tougher measures to avoid disaster.
In France, Catherine Le Bris at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne wonders how to reconcile emergency situations, the limitation of freedoms and the rule of law. The balance lies in the respect of human rights she argues (in French).

– Finally, Michael Baker at the University of Otago returns to the essential point of all these efforts: to control the pandemic. He is a professor of public health and is “overjoyed” that shutdowns are happening.
Revealing inequalities
The current pandemic is also exacerbating inequalities. 

Panic buying. James Lappeman at the University of Cape Town has focused on the panic buying triggered by the coronavirus panic. But this sheds a harsh light on economic inequality.
Inequality. Pandemics reveal inequality as never before, and South Africa is a textbook case of this, according to Steven Friedman at the University of Johannesburg. 

But the current crisis could also be an opportunity to explore ways to reduce inequalities and to test new approaches, particularly economic ones.

“Helicopter money”, a theory coined by the economist Milton Friedman in the 1970s, could be used to reduce inequality by distributing money directly to the population, explains Baptiste Massenot at TBS Business School (in French). 

And finally, as a tribute to the “heroes in white coats”, The Conversation has published a series of testimonies from clinicians and researchers operating on the front lines of the pandemic – and providing advice on the conversations we should now be having with our loved ones.

<a href='https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-weekly-as-the-virus-spreads-economies-grind-to-a-halt-134214'>Coronavirus weekly: as the virus spreads, economies grind to a halt</a><br/><br/>
Health care systems around the world are ramping up their response to the spread of COVID-19, like this hospital in Washington state.  AP Photo/Ted S. WarrenEven as China, South Korea and Singapore make progress controlling the new coronavirus, its spread raises alarm in many more parts of the globe as the pathogen’s toll on human health and world economies climbs.
In the past week many more citizens have had to stay at home in the hope that infection rates can be slowed to prevent health systems being overwhelmed. The collapse in consumer activity has sent stock markets swooning, prompting governments and central banks to take steps to soften the blow of an expected global recession.
At the same time, public health authorities around the world are devising strategies to contain the spread, hoping to avoid the plight of the worst-hit countries, such as Iran and Italy, which has now has had more deaths than China from the virus.
At The Conversation, editors have been working closely with academic experts in a range of disciplines from around the world to convey the scope of this fast-moving story and to help readers understand what it all means. In this third weekly column, here are some of the themes editors at The Conversation International network covered.

Public health responses
Public health agencies have responded to the crisis in very different ways. Our experts explained how critical those differences are to each country’s trajectory thus far and, potentially, in the future.

Singapore, the model response? Singapore, which suffered from the SARS epidemic in the early 2000s, had a highly organized response that, among other things, avoided a lockdown. The chair of infection control for National University of Singapore, Dale Fisher, explains how the country did it and the lessons for other countries. 
South Korea’s contact tracing. South Korea, too, has been held up as a global model. One interesting aspect of its response is its acceptance of surveillance systems, notably CCTV and the tracking of bank card and mobile phone usage, to control the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The picture in Africa. There have been comparatively few reported cases in Africa so far. Akebe Luther King Abia, research scientist from University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa explains why that might, adding that countries on the continent need to do much more to prepare their health systems and public responses. Meanwhile, among many people in South Africa, joking is a common way to cope.


Grim economic outlook
Even as governments deal with the pandemic, they are trying to forestall what’s expected to be widespread economic pain caused by the halt of so much economic activity. In the U.S., the White House and Congress are seeking to spur economic activity through multiple measures, including tax cuts, business loans and handing out money to families, on the order of US$1,200 per taxpayer.

Direct payments to citizens are particularly beneficial to low-wage workers, many of whom will be hurt by the slowdown in consumer spending, says economist Steven Pressman from Colorado State University. 
Low to middle-income countries more vulnerable. Globally, the impact of the coronavirus could be worse on low to middle-income countries and harm particularly vulnerable people, say professor of public policy David Evans of Pardee RAND Graduate School and Mead Over of Georgetown University. As previous pandemics have shown, the short-term shocks on the economy typically translate into slowing long-term growth.


On the front lines of science
Scientists are racing to get a better understanding of the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2.

Seeking the virus’s origin. Researcher Alexandre Hassanin, of Sorbonne Université, ISYEB - Institut de Systématique, Evolution, provides some context for one of the most vexing questions facing scientists: did it originate in a bat or pangolin and where? He describes a recent genetic analysis  which suggests that the “SARS-Cov-2 virus is the result of a recombination between two different viruses.” (To read the original article in French, click here.)
The quest for anti-viral treatments. Could existing drugs work? Nevan Krogan, who is director of Quantitative Biosciences Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, describes the work of a 22-lab research team working around the clock to identify the most promising candidates for disarming this new virus.  
The biology of why elders are more at risk. As scientists generate new data on how COVID-19 affects people, one point is very clear: Older people and those with chronic medical conditions are most at risk of serious illness or death. Brian Geiss, associate professor of microbiology, immunology and pathology at Colorado State University, explains how changes to a person’s immune system as we age affects its ability to fight off infections like COVID-19.

Changes to daily life
For people who remain healthy and staying at home, the virus has upended many lives.

Confused children. Child development experts from the University of Calgary explain how parents can talk to their children about the pandemic.
Complex daily decisions. Many people isolating themselves at home still have questions. Adam Kamradt-Scott from the University of Sydney gets into a more nuanced discussion around social distancing and tries to answer basic questions such as: Can I take the dog for a walk?
The psychological toll. Finally, one common thread across all countries is stressed-out individuals. Nita Bharti from the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University offers some tips on how to maintain physical and mental health during this period.

 Fusion Medical Animation/UnsplashThe global crisis triggered by the spread of the new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, continues to take fresh and dramatic turns, causing havoc in dozens of countries around the world. Stock markets remain volatile, having recorded historic collapses in share prices.



US S&P500 Intraday volatility (the swing from high to low within one day) is approaching what was observed during the global financial crisis.


As the disease continued to spread – to new geographies as well as in numbers – governments began to take what just weeks ago might have seemed extreme measures in a bid to contain it. Italy enforced a nationwide lockdown while several other countries issued travel restrictions. Schools and universities were shut down in some territories, while thousands of companies told their employees to work from home.
By March 16, at the time of writing, COVID-19 had been detected in almost 150 countries, according to the World Health Organization, which now regards the crisis as a pandemic. More than 160 000 people had been diagnosed and fatalities had risen to close to 6,500.

Amid all of the uncertainty about how the pandemic might unfold, and what its implications may be, articles from The Conversation have provided a unique guide. Publishing in four languages – English, French, Bahasa Indonesia and Spanish – The Conversation’s eight editions have seen a spike in readership. We hope this is providing an antidote to misinformation emanating from some social and mainstream media.
In this second weekly column by our team of international health editors we are, once again, highlighting some of the most recently published articles from The Conversation’s global network.
Prepare for our new way of life
One thing has become evident: we have to prepare for a new way of life. Experts have weighed in on what this might entail:

Close schools and universities? From the International University of La Rioja, Spain, Vicente Soriano makes the argument for closure (in Spanish) while Kyungmee Lee from Lancaster University, UK, argues that moving university courses online isn’t as simple as it sounds.
Cancelling public gatherings. Another dramatic change has been the escalating cancellation of public gatherings and major sporting events. Simon Chadwick of EM Lyon Business School considers the decimation of the international sporting calendar. Kari Brossard Stoos from Ithaca College, US, and Heather Dichter from De Montfort University, UK, explore how these cancellations will impact on the Olympic Games.
“Telehealth” could play a role in limiting the spread of the virus. Centaine Snoswell and Anthony Smith from the University of Queensland in Australia explain what it is. 
End of the handshake. Erika Hughes from the University of Portsmouth, UK, looks at why COVID-19 could change greetings forever. 

Epidemic, pandemic? The differences and key implications
Another big question academics addressed regarded the WHO’s decision to ramp up its definition of the outbreak from an epidemic to a pandemic.

What’s the difference between epidemic and pandemic? From Texas A&M University, US, assistant professor of epidemiology Rebecca S.B. Fischer explains.
What drove the escalation from epidemic to pandemic? Fernando González Candelas head of the joint research unit on infection and public health at Valencia University, Spain, and writing in Spanish, reports.
What’s the UK doing differently? It appears that the British government is pursuing a different approach to that taken in other countries. Is this sensible? Jeremy Rossman of the University of Kent, UK, writes.

Why it’s time to read about Spanish flu
Academics have also offered historical perspectives, reaching back to the Spanish flu epidemic a century ago. Howard Phillips from the University of Cape Town, South Africa, reflects on the elementary mistakes in the repatriation of South African soldiers from England in 1918. Meanwhile, Chris Colvin from Queen’s University Belfast, UK, and Eoin McLaughlin from University College Cork, Ireland, explore the economic lessons to be learned from the Spanish flu.
Coronavirus is also spreading misinformation
Along with the spread of the disease comes the spread of misinformation.

Vitamin C protects against coronavirus? Peter McCaffery, professor of biochemistry at the University of Aberdeen debunks a very common myth: taking vitamin C is unlikely to prevent or cure a coronavirus infection.
How to engage with the news in times of crisis. Professor of journalism and social media at Griffith University, Australia, Mark Pearson, offers advice. And Denis Muller from the University of Melbourne, Australia, highlights the importance of making sure that journalists apply the highest ethical standards in their reporting of the COVID-19 outbreak.


Who is patient zero?
Massive questions still remain. One is who or what infected “Patient Zero”. Wanda Markotter from the University of Pretoria, South Africa, unpacks steps scientists have taken to track the original source of COVID-19.
The good news is that there’s a great deal of knowledge sharing taking place internationally to tackle this pandemic, and Aleks Berditchevskaia and Kathy Peach from the Centre for Collective Intelligence Design at Nesta, UK, look at seven ways in which this is happening.

<a href='https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-a-weekly-update-from-the-conversations-global-network-of-academics-133294'>Coronavirus: a weekly update from The Conversation's global network of academics</a><br/><br/>
The year had barely begun when stories started to emerge of a worrying number of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, caused by a mysterious new “coronavirus”. The Conversation published its first story on the outbreak on January 13. At that point, it was spreading in China, with a few people testing positive in Thailand, South Korea and Japan.
Less than two months later, the virus (officially named SARS-CoV-2) has hit more than 100 countries, claiming more than 3,800 lives and infecting over 111,000 people. Regions on opposite sides of the globe are in lockdown. The international economy is in turmoil. Flights are grounded, with at least one airline already having gone out of business. Fear has lead to xenophobia and shops are selling out of essentials – including toilet paper.
The Conversation’s unique global network of academics, producing rapid, trustworthy journalism, has played a crucial role in separating fact from fiction at this time of international uncertainty. Operating in four languages (English, French, Bahasa Indonesia and Spanish), our editors have provided co-ordinated and pointed coverage that has reached millions of readers. Now, with the world still seemingly much nearer the beginning than the end of this crisis, we launch this weekly column spotlighting coronavirus coverage from all eight editions of the network. There is already so much being read and republished (for free, we have no paywall, as we exist to disseminate information and democratise knowledge for the public at large). This new weekly update will see different Conversation editors around the world focus on key themes related to the virus, highlighting some of the best of network’s content.

The story so far
Initially, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided that the outbreak wasn’t a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). We had an expert on hand to explain why. But the situation changed rapidly, and on January 30 the disease was declared a global health emergency. Aubree Gordon, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan, gave a clear account of exactly what that means.
By then, people were hungry for knowledge about the new threat. With access to thousands of experts via our global network, The Conversation has been able to provide evidence-based advice on everything from how to wash and (importantly) dry your hands, to how to protect your children, to whether facemasks provide any protection.
Economy in meltdown
We have also had authoritative coverage on the growing impact on the world economy of COVID-19 (the official name for the disease), how it is making science more open (and the concomitant risks it entails), and how vaccine development is progressing.
Our coverage has included a look at the steps Nigeria is taking to prepare for an outbreak, how governments in South-East Asia are tackling medical misinformation, and what the coronavirus emergency declaration means for Canada.
Authors have also sought to put the outbreak in context of other pandemics. A researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine launched an interactive map on The Conversation that lets readers scroll through time to see how the disease has spread. It also compares the COVID-19 outbreak with other infectious disease outbreaks, such as Sars, swine flu and Ebola. Other authors went further back in time and compared the current outbreak with the Black Death, both in terms of the economic impact and the spread of misinformation.
Indeed, misinformation and conspiracy theories have been rife since the start of the outbreak. Paranoia even gripped beer drinkers, as sales of Corona beer suddenly slumped.
Global network
The antidote to this nonsense is sober and reliable information, clearly written and easy to understand, so it is able to reassure rather than alarm. The Conversation’s global network of academic authors works with professional journalists to provide you with informed and up-to-date information.
As the pandemic runs its course, we will continue to bring you journalism from experts, writing within their areas of deep knowledge. We are currently working on a range of articles, including one on how coronavirus should make us hopeful about our ability to tackle the climate crisis, another on how to stop anxiety about the pandemic from spiralling out of control, and one on how the seasons might change the course of the outbreak. As a network of not-for-profit organisations, our only aim is to help you stay informed.
Over the coming weeks please stay tuned to our coverage, sign up for your regional Conversation daily newsletter, wash your hands regularly, and only follow bona fide expert advice. And don’t be too despondent. A leading microbiologist at the University of Navarra in Spain says that we have never been more prepared to fight a pandemic. And millions of you have already read his words in Spanish, French and English.
This outbreak will undoubtedly continue. During that time, we will provide you with trustworthy content from our global network of experts. And each week will publish a post like this summing up the unfolding story.<br/><br/>
<a href='http://theconversation.com/how-yemeni-women-are-fighting-the-war-89951'>How Yemeni women are fighting the war</a><br/><br/>
Since 2015, a Saudi-led coalition has waged war against Shia Houthi forces in Yemen. More than 8,000 people have been killed, and more than 49,000 injured; at least 69% of the population is reportedly in need of humanitarian assistance. Million of Yemenis are facing starvation. Weapons circulation is widespread and uncontrolled: in 2016, a UN report estimated that between 40m to 60m firearms were circulating freely in the country.
The conflict has had a devastating impact on the women of the country. Household breadwinners are usually men; many are fighting, injured or killed. There is an economic crisis in the private sector, and many public sector jobs are no longer paying salaries. The health and security of the female population is endangered by exposure to cholera and other diseases. And then there’s the issue of child marriages: the severe poverty crisis means that prepubescent girls are married off to repay debts, or to raise funds to feed the rest of the family. 
A woman from the Northern Ibb region, which is occupied by the rebel Houthi army, explained the situation to a research team: 

We live in a state of lawlessness: no security, no protection and no functional law enforcement authorities. A person may be shot dead for a trivial thing. The security situation doesn’t look like it did in the past. Now, there are informal groups behaving as if they were law enforcement authorities. These groups have power, and their power is the law. They use force against whoever disagrees with them or criticises their behaviour.

As the feminist scholar Cynthia Enloe has pointed out, women are crucial for war and play supportive roles for the military. Indeed, many Yemeni women are not victims of war or just escaping or hiding from this war. In many contrasting ways, they are actively supporting it, and not only on humanitarian grounds. 
Women engaging in war
Although many Yemeni women discourage their family members from taking part in the conflict and very few take up arms themselves, they also help recruit men to the army. They also support combatants by cooking food for them and helping to distribute it. 
A young woman, Nasseem Al-Odaini, whose family has fled to the neighbouring Ibb region, stayed behind in Houthi-occupied Taiz and initiated an organisation that assist the combatants that support the former government. As she told Middle East Eye: “We want to encourage the pro-government forces to advance in the province, by raising the spirits of the fighters”.
Other Yemeni women try to mitigate the impact of the conflict the best way possible. For example, women engage in humanitarian relief and in providing social and psychological support for people who have been traumatised by the war. They also engage in peace processes when they initiate discussions of the conflict in their communities.
Since the war is not equally intense in every part of the country, there are better possibilities for women to participate in peace processes around the port city of Aden, in the south, than it is in the north, where the Houthi army has taken control and Saudi coalition airstrikes are part of everyday life. Accordingly, women’s conditions and activities differ from one region to another.
A blocked momentum
In the north, local communities are more divided (between supporters and adversaries of the Houthi government) than in the south. When women enter the public and participate in charity work, they may be questioned by “de facto authorities” (read: the Houthi army) who, according to one woman, would try to prevent them from doing their work. They would also tell women that they are not allowed to appear in public before men:

They [the Houthis] are opposed to women playing a role in public life. According to them, the woman’s role is restricted to cooking and housework. They marginalise women; they deny their role in the community.

Women in Northern and Southern parts of Yemen are not full citizens. According to Amnesty International, they “face discrimination in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance, and child custody, and the state fails to take adequate measures to prevent, investigate, and punish domestic violence”. Discrimination against women in Yemen go back far beyond the war and are associated with local customs according to several studies. And yet, Yemeni women maintain their engagement in the development of their country. 
An old engagement
During the popular uprising in the country in 2011 where hundreds of thousands of Yemenis followed the “youth movement” and protested against the corrupt reign of the then-president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, Yemeni women took to the streets to an extent that was unforeseen and unprecedented. 
Many women participants were independent of political groups, but in the later stages of the protests the Islamic Reform party – inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood – managed to take charge of the protest movement, raising independent women’s concern that their rights would be disregarded.
However, independent women and women belonging to the political parties, including the Islamic Reform party and the Houthi political wing, Ansar Allah, constituted almost one third of participantsin the UN-guided National Dialogue Conference which followed the forced resignation of the President in November 2011. The aim of the 10 months long conference was to formulate a new and more democratic constitution for a united Yemen. However, the draft constitution which included a general 30% gender quota was rejected  by the Houthi movement in September 2014, before the population had given their voice in a referendum. 
By then disappointment with the process towards a new Yemen had given the Houthis wide popular support. They occupied major government institutions in the capital, Sana'a and removed the transition government recognised internationally. Interestingly, it was not the gender quota which made the Houthis reject the draft constitution, but the view to a power-sharing model which did not give them what they expected.
The Houthi movement’s occupation of the capital and seizure of government seemed to mark both the beginning of a war, and the end of momentum for women’s rights in Yemen – a country which generally figures in the lowest ranks of Arab gender equality indexes. In 2014, a group of women from diverse political backgrounds pushed for political solutions instead of war. Since then they have been sidelined from peace negotiations – but that doesn’t mean that Yemeni women have lost all hope.

<a href='http://theconversation.com/why-the-un-is-setting-up-a-database-of-international-businesses-operating-in-israeli-settlements-85499'>Why the UN is setting up a database of international businesses operating in Israeli settlements</a><br/><br/>
Hundreds of companies are doing business in around 250 illegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, that are effectively subsidised and maintained by the Israeli government. In December, a United Nations’ database of businesses that operate in the settlements is due to be finalised. 
Israel and the US have attacked the database and want to prevent its release. On November 26, Israel’s UN ambassador, Danny Danon, told The Associated Press “we will do everything we can to ensure that this list does not see the light of day”. 
The database is being established under the auspices of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). This effort has recently been supported by dozens of international and local rights groups, including Amnesty International, the International Federation for Human Rights, and Human Rights Watch. As a regulatory initiative for the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), the database’s aim is to help businesses and states ensure that they do not contribute to or benefit from activities in Israel’s settlements.
The UN is due to release the database by the beginning of 2018, after reportedly engaging with as many as 150 companies, of which 60 are foreign and the rest Israeli. 
To protect the legitimacy of the database and shield it from criticism, the UN must clarify its function, and show that it is not a punitive device but a vital resource for furthering business transparency and enabling business and state compliance with their existing obligations under international law.
Human rights compliance
The database began with a recommendation in a 2013 UN fact-finding mission report on Israel’s settlements, endorsed by the Human Rights Council in March 2016. 



In Israel’s settlements, as the Human Rights Council’s March 2017 resolution affirmed, “it is not possible for businesses to take appropriate steps in view of the immitigable nature of the adverse impact of their activities on human rights”. All  business transactions in or related to Israel’s settlements contribute to the illicit financial flows generated by the wrongful enjoyment of unlawfully appropriated property rights obtained by the Israeli government.
The need to monitor the involvement of foreign and Israeli businesses in Israel’s settlements was kindled by UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which held that Israel’s settlement activity in occupied territory has “no legal validity and constitutes a flagrant violation under international law,” and called on third states to exclude settlement-based entities and activities from their dealings with Israeli entities.
To date, some 18 European government advisories warned businesses of the economic, financial, and legal risks of business activities in Israel’s settlements. In recent years a host of companies, financial institutions and pension funds, among them a Norwegian government fund, Dutch pension fund, Danish bank and Dutch engineering company decided to terminate operations in the Palestinian territories. 
Engagement, not punishment
The UN database is a mechanism to document, report, and engage primary interested parties. It does not have the mandate to adjudicate the responsibility of concerned parties, nor to act as a coercive tool of law enforcement. Thus, commentators who refer to it as a “blacklist” misrepresent it and undermine its legitimacy.
To maximise its effectiveness, the database must be able to engage and cooperate with businesses that operate in the territories and their home states. It cannot afford to alienate its target audiences by operating as an adjudicative or coercive body.
The OHCHR should learn from the pitfalls of previous UN-led efforts to list businesses. Take the UN Center for Transnational Corporations: its mandate to report on businesses in Apartheid-era South Africa never gained adequate support because it was presented as a sanction. The UN panel on the plunder of resources in the DRC produced a list of businesses, which was discredited for failing to gain businesses’ cooperation.
There is no doubt that the UN database will be embroiled in political turmoil. It may not be the first of its kind, but it could well become the first to function as a regulatory tool that gains support, and encourages compliance with international law.
To ensure its ability to further respect for international law, the database should be seen as a pilot mechanism that could be used beyond the Israel-Palestine context. And the mechanism behind the database could be readily applied in other parts of the world where military occupation is used to pursue the permanent acquisition or transformation of territory.
Valentina Azarova is a legal adviser for the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN) and a board member of Heartland Initiative. She authored a legal opinion on the methodology of the database methodology for Diakonia's IHL Resource Centre, which became the basis for a private submission to the OHCHR by a group of non-profit organisations.<br/><br/>
