              The License for the Swiss Ephemeris Free Edition
	      This is a preliminary version subject to change

Included below is draft version 0.2 of the license that we are currently
using for the Swiss Ephemeris Free Edition. The license
is called the Swiss Ephemeris Public License (or "SEPL"), and qualifies as
an Open Source license. It is thus appropriate for people wishing to write
software under the Open Source model where all source code to the software
is made available to all users and can be freely modified and redistributed.

To develop software with the Swiss Ephemeris Free Edition, simply meet the
requirements in the SEPL. Your software can be licensed by any license that
permits the requirements in section 6.

If you do not meet the requirements in the SEPL, for example if
- you develop and distribute software which is sold for a fee higher than a
reasonable copy charge
- or/and you develop and distribute software which is not published under an
Open Source or equivalent license
you must purchase the Swiss Ephemeris Professional Edition under the Swiss
Ephemeris Professional License.

Comments to the license:

'Legally' developed in 5 means either developed under this license, 6, or
under a professional license.

This license applies to any software containing a notice placed by the
copyright holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms of the
SEPL version 0.2. Such software is herein referred to as the Swiss Ephemeris

use of third-party application programs based on the
SE, and development of free software which uses the SE.

                               Granted Rights

1. You are granted the rights set forth in this license provided you agree
to any and all conditions in this license. Whole or partial distribution of
the SE in any form signifies acceptance of this license.   

2. You may copy and distribute the SE provided that
the entire package is distributed, including this License.

3. You may make modifications to the SE files and distribute your
modifications in a form distinct from the SE. The following
restrictions apply to modifications:             

     a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in the SE.

     b. If modifications to the SE are released under this
     license, a non-exclusive right is granted to the holder of the
     copyright of the unmodified SE to distribute your
     modification in future versions of the SE provided such
     versions remain available under these terms in addition to any
     other license.  

4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the SE or
machine-executable forms of modified versions of the SE, provided that
you meet these restrictions:  

     a. You accompany the SE with this license.

     b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable
     forms are also able to receive the complete machine-readable
     source code to the distributed SE, including all
     modifications, without any charge beyond the costs of data
     transfer.

     c. You ensure that all modifications included in the
     machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this
     license.                          

5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Swiss Ephemeris
Software to compile, link and run application programs legally developed by
you or third parties.

software items that link with the original or modified versions of the Swiss
Ephemeris Software. These items, when distributed in machine-executable form,
have the following restrictions:  

     a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms
     of these items are also able to receive and use the complete
     machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
     beyond the costs of data transfer.

     b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
     and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
     both machine-executable and source code forms under terms
     identical to those under which they received the items.
