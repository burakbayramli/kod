With Neptune aligned with their egos and their wills, people born under this
aspect seek out some added dimension in their lives. Whether that is spiritual,
artistic, or simply "different", there is some kind of quest for higher meaning
with this aspect. Neptune acts to soften the will, which can translate to a
weakened willpower and susceptibility or impressionability. On the other hand,
it can also signify a person who doesn't want to be defined by the ego--someone
who seeks to breakdown ego boundaries. Divine inspiration or a life of delusion?
Much depends on the rest of the chart and how evolved the native is.

<br/><br/>

These people are dreamers and idealists. They resist being labeled or
defined. It's truly hard to pin these people down. Neptune acts to heighten or
add a dimension to whatever planet it contacts. With the Sun, there is a need to
experience something more than the simple self. Those born under a Sun-Neptune
conjunction may glamorize their role in the world, or they seek to connect to
something higher than themselves. They want to be something special, and it can
be easy, with this sensitivity, to feel disappointed with the ordinary
grind. Their memories of their lives and their experiences can be far removed
from reality.

<br/><br/>

Sometimes those with this aspect have dreamy ideas about men in general. There
may have been a missing or weak father figure in early childhood. The experience
of this confusing figure is carried with the child through life and is partly
responsible for the grown-up child's identity problems. Sometimes it doesn't
have to do with the father or father figure specifically, but early childhood
featured a confusion of boundaries or a lack of clearly defined rules or
direction.

<br/><br/>

A great appreciation for music is usually present, and often for other art
forms. An attraction to spiritual and metaphysical subjects is usually
characteristic of these people. A distinctly emotional and sensitive personality
is also common. At their best, people with Sun conjunct Neptune in their charts
are very compassionate and tolerant people. They are susceptible to being led
astray or used, as they too readily believe in others' integrity.
