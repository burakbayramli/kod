With Moon conjunct Mercury, these people sometimes have a direct pipeline to
their emotions and feelings, and are able to talk about them easily. On the
other hand, there can be a tendency to rationalize feelings to the point that
feelings are rarely felt. This is because the Moon is the feeling function and
Mercury represents the lower mind--the part of our minds that processes
information, analyzes impressions, and sorts things out. In some ways, Moon
conjunct Mercury is similar to Moon in Gemini.

<br/><br/>

These people are generally quite expressive and animated in their speech. They
have outstanding memories and tend to pick up a lot of information from their
environment. These people love to chat and to exchange ideas. Even if they are
shy, once you're friends, they love to talk about pretty much anything under the
sun, and they do enjoy sharing stories from their past! For the most part, they
are focused on day-to-day activities in their communications rather than on
grander philosophies.

<br/><br/>

Moon conjunct Mercury people are accommodating and curious, but they are not as
well equipped to handle heavy emotional demands. They thrive on change and
variety. Some are addicted to gossip! Most, however, are simply very curious
about others.

<br/><br/>

Instead of allowing themselves to feel on a pure level, these people are
constantly asking themselves how they feel. The need to define their feelings
rather than experience them as is can be a problem. On the other hand, they are
experts at communicating with sensitivity. They are also true problem
solvers--completely confident that any predicament can be solved by analyzing
the issue and logically arriving at an answer. They are helpful people who
possess an inherent and natural concern for others. Sometimes, their advice
feels a little bit too logical and rational...sometimes. But there are usually
good intentions behind these tidbits. Mind you, when they are moody, it can be
difficult to understand them, as they are very subjective and have problems
expressing themselves clearly. There is also a distinct sensitivity to
criticism, or perceived criticism, of their ideas and intellect.

<br/><br/>

There is a twinkle in their eyes, and these people are never short on
humor. They are playful and versatile--they make fun companions and interesting
friends. They listen! Yes, they do talk and occasionally interrupt in their
excitement, but they are curious people who do want to hear what you have to
say, and that is a real pleasure. In fact, they are more able than most people
to get you talking, simply because they are very receptive and sympathetic.
