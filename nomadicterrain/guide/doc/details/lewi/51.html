Your sign suggests that you are a person possessed with both action
and ideas. This combination blends the vitality, personal warmth,
generosity, authoritativeness of Leo, with the intelligence,
cleverness, flexibility and adaptability of Gemini. Your personality
is perpetually searching for ways to impress others via these action
or achievements, and, especially by matters of the mind, or your
ideas. Your mind is facile and intuitive, rather than profound or over
serious. Your ability to make good impressions on people serves you
well in your public life and in dealing with those within your sphere
of influence. Your ideas, while not based on deep philosophy, are
usually plausible, and always delivered with a manner of expression
that is persuasive. You like to work with your mind, and you're rarely
found working very hard for a living. You believe in easy money and
seem to know how to get it without exerting great amounts of physical
energy. Mentally, you would never be called lazy. At times you can
become so mentally active that you would turn into a bundle of
nerves. You never really stop trying to impress others with what you
know, and you are a very interesting conversationalist. You are also
very social and love to entertain, especially when your guests are
interesting people who stimulate you mentally. Your glib analyses and
sharp observations make you a favorite with such groups.
