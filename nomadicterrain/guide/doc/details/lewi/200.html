For people with a Venus-Mars conjunction in their natal charts, the blending of
the feminine and masculine energies within is a natural process, although other
aspects to the conjunction will tell the whole story as to how this is
done. These people possess personal magnetism in spades. They live and breathe
romantic/sexual relationships. It is generally easy for them to form
relationships, unless the conjunction is severely afflicted. They ooze
sexuality, and they are generally quite impulsive with regards to entering new
relationships. Relationships are not only important to them, they require a fair
amount of excitement, adventure, and passion in their pairings in order to feel
alive and vital. With this conjunction, there is generally a pleasing blend of
self-assertion and cooperation. This comprises some of their charm, in that they
generally know how to assert themselves without stepping on others' toes. In
some cases, men with this aspect may be too dominating in romantic situations,
and might gain a reputation for being "macho". This is not always the case,
however. For the most part, these people are quite direct about what they want
in a relationship, and they are quite passionate when it comes to going about
getting what they want. It can be a challenge maintaining perspective when it
comes to relationships. These people are generally highly creative and are bent
on finding outlets for their creativity. Their vitality and warm energy is
something that can be felt by others, as if it lies just below the surface.

You are extremely amorous and it is difficult for you to go without a
romantic involvement for very long. When you are attracted to someone,
you pursue them very ardently and sometimes come on too strong. Doing
creative work or artistic work can also satisfy the very strong desire
for love and beauty that you feel.
