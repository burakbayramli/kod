<p>
This is the square of "radicalism" and "new generation" that so much shaped and
defined the generation of post Word War II generation. This angle creates
thought and action leaders. It creates people with wide social awareness, and it
also creates self aware people who measure their self worth using out of the
ordinary ways and measures.

This is also an angle of an "earty idealism" - there will be a level of
pragmatisim in your even utmost utopic ideas.
