<h3>109</h3>
<p>
You have a very forceful and purposeful personality. You have a strong
drive to succeed, and you're willing to work very hard to insure that
this becomes a reality. Prestige is vital to your happiness. You know
how to impress people, but you steadfastly refuse to give any
appearance of bowing and scraping, or to make any gesture of empty
flattery. You can be counted on to be tactfully agreeable while barely
being able to hold back your own very distinct personal opinions. With
some experience, you may at least learn to hold your tongue and
exercise a minimal degree of patience when dealing with the many
lacking your capacity for putting thought into action. This pairing
suggests a rather shrewd quality in your nature, and it likewise makes
it very clear that you understand well the ways of the world and you
know how to deal with them very effectively. Your brand of tact is to
speak softly and carry a big stick; diplomacy combined with a vigorous
invulnerability. You have a good head for working out solutions to
many sorts of problems. You have an honorable, if gruff, way of
dealing with people. You're not one to pull the wool over someone's
eyes, but you may do a bit of fast talking to win your point when this
becomes necessary. You know how to get a project off the ground, to
generate enthusiasm, and get long-range plans into effect. You are the
type that will take on so much that you can work yourself into a
nervous breakdown if you're not careful. You should learn moderation
in work, in opinions, and in the general forcefulness of your nature.
