People born with flowing aspects between the Sun and Mars are generally
enterprising. They have powerful stores of energy that they can draw upon when
needed. These people respond to problems or challenges with a spirited and
enthusiastic confidence that is admirable. They are naturally competitive, and
this trait is generally well-received by others simply because it is unforced,
unaffected, and sincere. These people truly believe in fair play, and they seem
to be in love with life. When they are expressing competitiveness and courage,
it's easy to smile and accept these traits as positive ones rather than being
rubbed the wrong way. These people generally have good physical vitality.

It is interesting to note that these people are not naturally combative. Many
enjoy sports or games that are competitive, but not violent. Breaking the rules
of a competitive game is particularly upsetting to those with Sun in easy aspect
to Mars. This is largely due to the fact that the will (Sun) is connected to the
desire nature (Mars) in a pleasing manner, so that the natives are more able
than most to control their desires, aggressions, and instincts. They know how to
be fair, and they expect others to be fair. As such, sneaky behaviors,
uncontrolled impulses, violence, and rage are offensive to them. They know how
to direct and control their own impulses and desire natures, and they fully
expect others to be able to do so!

The main difference between the sextile and trine of the Sun and Mars: The trine
is a more natural energy. Those with Sun trine Mars naturally and without
thought are courageous and enterprising. Those with Sun sextile Mars have the
opportunity to draw upon their courageous and enterprising spirit, but effort is
required to pull these energies out of themselves and to apply these energies in
their lives. With the trine, the characteristics of Sun-Mars come so naturally
that the natives may not even realize just how much endurance, confidence, and
enthusiasm they possess. Because the sextile requires some effort and thought,
those with Sun sextile Mars often have many creative tools at their disposal,
and they can be effective strategists and leaders.
