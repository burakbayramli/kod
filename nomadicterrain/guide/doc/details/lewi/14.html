<h3>14</h3>
<p>
Your sign amplifies the determination and purposeful nature of this
sign of the Bull. Your concentration and staying power is second to
none. Concentration is the base of your renowned tendency toward
stubbornness, in that when you apply your mind to a subject, nothing
is likely to distract your attention. Accordingly, you can focus with
equal tenacity on your work, your domestic life, and your leisure
activities. You are never one to jump to conclusions, but once you
have made up your mind, you are never likely to modify your views. You
are highly conventional, and you have a great regard for the
establishment and the status quo. Change is something you prefer to
avoid because you are slow to adjust and dislike being required to do
so. You make a good friend because you are honest and loyal. You enjoy
good friends, good food, good music, and in general, the "good life."
You are materialistic, but with a special knack for saving and
reinvesting. You are always a hard worker, and you don't mind starting
at the bottom and slowly working your way to the top. You can achieve
success because the work you do is done well and you are totally
dependable. Patient and calm, your "tongue in cheek" diplomacy
designed to humor opponents until, in the end, you have your own
way. You respect authority simply because you expect someday to have
it.
