Your emotions, particularly when it comes to feelings of love and attachment,
run very deep. Your personality is magnetic, and you tend to arouse strong
feelings in others, who may find you intriguing or somehow offensive! In love,
you can be quite possessive and possibly obsessive. At the root of obsessive
feelings are deep fears of rejection, loss, and betrayal. Your feelings often
run hot or cold--your love nature is generally extreme. It's hard for you to
detach yourself and this sensitivity comes from a tendency to take things very
much to heart. You are certainly most charming when you want to be. Love
relationships turn your world upside down. You are likely to experience love at
first sight, as you tend to work on instinct when it comes to affairs of the
heart. Your relationships often feel fateful. You easily put pressure on your
partner, as you expect much loyalty and honesty in your intimate
relationships. Be careful not to let your relationships get to a point where
your partner is superfluous and you are working through your own inner demons
through him or her. Certainly, you will learn much about yourself through your
relationships, and you may not always like what you see. You will meet yourself
(the "darker" side or inner demons) through your relationships, and it will be
critical that you recognize it as your own "material" and not project it onto
your partner. On another level, you may have a talent for drama, writing lyrics,
music in general, and finance.

<br/><br/>

You are extremely loyal to and solicitous of those you love, without a cloying
sentimentality. Your values and thoughts center on love, which can easily become
the hub of your life. Early in a relationship, you are apt to be jealous and
possessive, but with time and experience this can be transformed into a higher,
more mature type of attachment. You are willing to give your all to your beloved
but demand the same in return. Your strongest desire is for an all-consuming
love that will bring you satisfaction on all levels: emotional, physical and
spiritual. With aspects to Mars or Neptune, there could be a preoccupation with
or compulsive attitude toward sex.

<br/><br/>

You may not be particularly sentimental but if you love someone, you love them
completely and forever. You live on the emotional extremes. People are either
important to you or they don't even exist. Your feelings are deep and
volcanic. You love power and control which is fine if you have learned to
control yourself. You are magnetic and surrounded with an aura of mystery. You
deal with groups and group resources. You may have leadership in some creative
project or in some financial enterprise. You polarize people: they either love
you or hate you but are seldom indifferent to you. 

<br/><br/>

You have deep, compelling love feelings that seem irresistible and often
irrational. Your love relationships are very passionate and intense, and you
experience both agony and ecstasy in love. You are always changed in a deep,
fundamental way by your love experiences, though this may come about through
painful and difficult confrontations or separations. You are something of an
emotional fanatic about things you care about.

<br/><br/>

You are the stuff of saints and martyrs because you engage in your beliefs with
a fanatical desire to conquer anyone in your path. A physical love relationship
can make or break your spiritual connection, depending on your ability to
nurture the depth of feeling.
