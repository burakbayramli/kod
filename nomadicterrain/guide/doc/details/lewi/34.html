<h3>34</h3>
<p>
You have a personality that is worldly-wise and shrewd. Under the
genial front of smiles and good humor lies a core of steel, strength
of purpose, and ambition. You operate with a healthy respect for
tradition, law, and authority, able to become a law unto yourself, and
to others. You can meet any challenge, especially one requiring a cool
head and objective reasoning ability. You are affable, social and
generous, but no one can impose on you; your business judgment is
amazingly sharp. Your keen wit allows you to talk people into
agreement with your position before they know what has happened. Your
manner is poised, charming and disarming, enabling you to succeed in
the business world where you can sell yourself or close a deal with
casual ease. People relax and let down their guard around
you. Outgoing and extroverted, you seem to inspire confidence and
usually come out a winner. Your mind is so well constructed that
analysis and critical ability come naturally. You are fair and utterly
honorable, but you never fail to bargain shrewdly. Nervousness and
restlessness are well controlled, and you are likely to be intensely
ambitious. There is a cool detachment about you that keeps you from
opening up to people in a true sense. You are highly sensitive and
likewise conscious of other people's sensitive points. You're more
analytical than creative or original. Your sense of diplomacy is
active and leads you to a policy of rarely antagonizing others to
achieve your ends.
