Your belief in your self worth is very strong, and this feeling will be your
ticket to a rich and good life. Others might have trouble understanding your
goals, but your hard work will attract them providing you as partners in your
path to success. Your entire being, energy and potential are meant to be for
success, but in one condition: It has to be your own way. You are not the type
of person who thinks highly of what other people find as worty goals or
rewards. Your innate fox-like intelligence supports, strengthens your decisions,
however, even if you are quick to offer advice, you don't seem to be too
enhusiastic about receving any. Your religious and philosophical ideals grow
with experience and act as ingredients that enrich your life.
