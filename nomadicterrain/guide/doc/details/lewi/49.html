<h3>49</h3>
<p>
You have intense emotions and a strong personal drive. You may display
exceptional courage because there is little that you are afraid of and
few challenges you are hesitant to undertake. You throw yourself into
every project with total commitment. You have a quick temper and you
are easy to excite to action. You consider any setback or loss as a
serious matter that must be responded to immediately and
positively. When your honor is questioned, even in the slightest way,
you are quick to respond defensively. Combativeness is almost
overpowering in your nature. You attack every problem as though it was
going to attack you. In personal relationships and the everyday world,
you come across as an executive person. Dynamic and willing to pursue
any possibility to further enhance your image and self-confidence, you
go after what you want with enthusiasm and intensity. You may be rash
and impulsive, but you're still willing to give about any idea a
try. Never hesitant or shirking, you assume responsibility and meet
obligations. You fear only someone who is your intellectual superior,
as you don't consider yourself particularly brilliant. Few will ever
notice any shortcoming here, as you always appear in complete control
and superior to all situations. A quick common sense mind is your
special gift. Fully developed, you'll easily remain in the drivers
seat.
