You have independence of thought, action, and speech. This is a
position of dynamic ideals and popular appeal. You believe in the
truth with an almost absolute devotion. This belief is perhaps not in
the truths of scientific investigation, but more likely in the proper
philosophies of life and other large issue abstractions. The natural
tendency for Aries to be the pioneer, the fighter, the doer, and the
initiator new concepts and ideas is not greatly modified by this
combination. Yet the Sagittarius Moon does impose a personal code of
ethics and honor that may not always be present in the brash Aries
native. In you, executive powers are strongly marked, taking the form
of controlling others with ideas and principles. The proper path that
should be followed is so clear to you that you are not one ever to
mince words in plotting the course. Your intensely emotional approach
to getting something accomplished can sometimes limit your awareness
of the feeling of others and you can be tough on those around you. The
human frailties of pettiness, emotionalism, and jealousy are not well
understood by you, and do not relate well with your totally open and
frank personality. You are definitely a leader of men, though you may
not always understand them, conversely, people may completely respect
you, but fault you for a lack of sensitivity. In all types of dealings
there is tendency to employ a broad brush approach often finding it
difficult to come down to the real and personal everyday issues. Your
best fields of endeavor will be found in the professions.
