<h3>11</h3>
<p>
Your sign indicates a nature that, while being somewhat
discriminating, is very sociable and magnetic. People respond to your
likable personality with few reservations. You have a good sense about
want is modern and progressive, and you're always eager to play an
important role in any kind of progress. But in fact, you are not an
especially tolerant person. Holding to the establishment more as a
reactionary than a liberal is more than likely your style. While you
work well with the public, there is a tendency within you to feel that
everyone should fend for themselves. You are not one to be
particularly charitable to those less fortunate than yourself. This
factor notwithstanding, you have innate social skills allowing you to
make each person you meet feel that they are uniquely important to
you. You have a noble air about you that is impressive and seems to
signal that you have a good deal of self-esteem. A certain aristocracy
of breeding is denoted by this position. This impresses those with
whom you come in contact and they respect you for this. You are quick
to judge people and situations, as your whole life seems to moves at a
pretty rapid pace. You are romantic and highly idealistic. This is a
good placement for material success and well-being, and for some
degree of public recognition.
