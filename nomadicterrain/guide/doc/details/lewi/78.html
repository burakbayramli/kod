<p>
You hav a personality that is very self-sufficient, analytical, and
critical. You reason things out and are not likely to be swept off
your feet by anything emotional that doesn't fit your needs. There is
little that escapes your perceptive and meticulous attention. You seem
to have absolutely no reluctance to get things off your chest, and at
times you can be a little vocal in expressing your views. You seem
reasonable in arguments, but usually you merely do exactly what you
want, no matter what is decided in the discussion. When you do get
really upset, which is not very often, you never hold a grudge. Things
are always very cut and dried to you, and it's hard for you to
understand how anyone could rationally see things differently than you
do. It's so easy for you to be objective since emotions have little
impact on any of your decisions. Because you do have a very
significant sympathetic side can make you seem more warmhearted than
you really are. You're a good listener when someone has problems to
unload, but your counsel may lack the human touch and you oversimplify
your resolution of the problem. You're always ready for a good time or
a social gathering. You have an attachment to old friends, but not
much emotional attachment to past events. You're not very emotional
about anything. Most or your assessments and pronouncements have a
"matter of fact" tone to them.
