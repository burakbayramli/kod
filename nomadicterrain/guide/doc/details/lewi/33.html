<h3>33</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces a very uncontrollable personality. You are frank,
honest, and very restless. Your highly individualistic nature has you
running in high gear nearly all the time. You are the type that knows
a little bit about many things, and you're sure always to have an
opinion on about any subject that comes up. Oddly enough, though your
knowledge is often rather superficial, you can level a scathing attack
on anyone who disagrees with one of your positions. Your honesty and
frankness can lead you into difficulties at times. Anyone who asks
will be told exactly what you think of them, with no omissions for the
sake of tact and diplomacy. It's not sacrificing your integrity to
hold your tongue at times, just showing good sense. You need to
cultivate mental accuracy, for the analytical and scientifically
critical bent is not native to you. Serious and specific mental
training is necessary to curb the restlessness in your nature. Your
witty personality and your quickness and facility of thought will take
you far, but sooner or later you will have to realize that the world
is not nearly as simple as you seem to think.
