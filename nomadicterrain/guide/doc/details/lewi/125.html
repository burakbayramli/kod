<p>
You have the sort of personality that is always there to help people
in need; a true humanitarian. Because this trait is so strong in your
nature, you're a bit of an easy mark for con men or other friends and
family that would take advantage. You are the one people come to when
they have problems and need help. You are proud, independent, and
self-reliant, and you don't like to have your original good opinion of
people upset. Because of this, you keep a bad bargain and perhaps stay
with a relationship that has gone sour. There are times, thanks to
your deeply emotional but expansive and friendly nature, that you need
to be hard-headed and practical in dealing with people, particularly
in handling people making demands on your time or money. This
combination blends the originality and independence of Aquarius with
the emotional warmth and confidence of Leo. Born near a full Moon, you
possess the inclination to project your personality into the world or
affairs. Sensitive and affectionate, marriage strongly influences your
life. Naturally friendly, you have a great capacity for kindness and
sympathy, and you love very deeply. Sometimes romantic interests may
cloud your judgment and ability for practical action. Just the same,
these are both fixed signs, and you are very hard to convince against
your will. You follow your inner feelings and can be positive and
determined when you feel you are right. As a leader, you employ a
style of warm and affection rather than by using more stern and
harsher methods. You have a tendency to be impulsive and jump to
conclusions, often making decisions without due forethought. Principle
means a great deal to you and you are strongly influenced by this and
by your feelings, affections, and emotions. Success comes most easily,
however, when you can keep your emotions under the control of your
intellect.
