<h3>21</h3>
<p>
Your sign blends two signs that are both extroverted and sociable, and
enjoy having a good time. Your sense of what constitutes a good time
is variable; sometimes simple and earthy, and other times much more
venturesome. Your highly developed social sense suggests that you like
people, but they must be the right people. You would rather be alone
than confined with people that you consider dull or
uninteresting. This is not to say you are necessarily class conscious,
for you can get along with all types of people with your ability to
say the right thing at the right time. Your manner of speaking is,
however, forthright and direct and you have no difficulty making your
sincerity and decisiveness felt. Your stubborn nature can express
itself in such a flexible way that you can discuss a subject at great
length without wavering from your original position. A tendency to
stick by your very high principles and code make you come across as a
moralist and one not above sitting in judgment of friend and
acquaintances. You feel you have a right to this as you are a pretty
good, law abiding, conventional human being. Talk is a specialty of
yours, especially when the talk can take on a personal touch. You
always enjoy exchanging tidbits of gossip and passing on rumors. You
try to like a good life; full and satisfying in an intellectual sense,
but pleasant and luxurious all the same.
