Those people born under a challenging aspect between the Sun and Saturn face a
fair number of challenges in their lives, especially in the first half of life,
in which their attempts to express their will are thwarted. There can be a
persistent feeling that they don't get what they want more often than other
people around them. They can feel unlucky. Attempts to control their
environment, and sometimes others, may be frequent.

<br/><br/>

These people fear their own feelings of inadequacy! They want to be considered
accomplished and important people, and when they face obstacles, they don't
always want to believe that they are their own worst enemy. They long to be
considered important in the eyes of the world, yet they harbor fear of success
at the same time. They take failures and minor setbacks to heart, and some
practically beat themselves up over them. Self-awareness to the point of real
self-consciousness is characteristic of Sun-Saturn challenging aspects. The
truth is, nobody holds a microscope over them, except for themselves. A little
setback or a faux pas needn't be analyzed to death. Fingers needn't be
pointed. No, they didn't make a spectacle of themselves when they made a
mistake. They need to stop worrying about always being right, or appearing suave
and accomplished. When they ease the pressure they put on themselves, they find
that they don't face as many brick walls. It is very much about what they feel
they deserve. Deep down inside, if they let themselves truly believe that they
deserve happiness and peace of mind, they will find it.

When Saturn is closely connected to a personal planet, there is usually an
effect of censoring going on with whatever is ruled by the planet it joins by
aspect. For example, with the Moon, which rules emotions, the natives feel the
need to censor their emotions and feelings, scanning them for what is thought to
be frivolous. With Saturn and the Sun, there is much self-censoring going on. "I
shouldn't.." is a common censoring mechanism with these people. They feel they
shouldn't want too much. When they express egotism of any form, some part of
them feels guilty. As the Sun rules our conscious mind, it does enough censoring
on its own. It is the "adult" within us. Saturn, on the other hand, is more like
the "parent" within us. We need parents to guide us when we are children, and to
some degree as adults, but for the most part, we don't need to be censored
indefinitely--something that seems to be the case with Saturn-Sun hard aspects,
except that the censoring and parenting is coming from within.

<br/><br/>

Ideally, these people eventually learn that the standards they set for
themselves are too high, and that may be the reason they seem to hit brick
walls. They recognize that many of the restrictions they face in life are often
self-created, born of a defeatist attitude. They should be aware of the tendency
to choose the hardest paths to travel and/or to deny themselves some of life's
pleasures. Working on recognizing and managing these tendencies will help them
to avoid the pitfalls of this combination. These people have a sarcastic sense
of humor, a keen intelligence, and the ability to apply caution and
strategy. The vitality may suffer, and troubles with the bones, teeth, and
circulation may surface.
