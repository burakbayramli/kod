You are an idealist bent on finding romantic adventure. You are a deep
feeling and understanding person. The emotional balance, courtesy and
friendliness of Libra blends well with the depth of feeling,
sensitivity and tenacity of Cancer. There often may be some confusion
in your life because what you think and what you "feel" may be at
odds. It's very difficult for you to decide what to do. Reality and
unreality constantly battle for your attention. Very much the
idealistic dreamer, you hold yourself somewhat removed from the rest
of society. Yet you do like people. You want and need human contact,
and you are so consonant that there is some danger people with take
advantage of your malleable manner. You understand the feelings and
moods of others, so you're very skilled at avoiding conflicts and
clashes of temperament. This position personifies the ideals of any
peace movement as you are a true lover of freedom, justice, equality,
and independence. By nature so peaceful and tactful, you will avoid
argument and strife if you possibly can. You are exceedingly
adaptable, taking on the color of your surroundings. You mind your own
business and don't impose on the rights of others. You aren't likely
to become a fighter for social justice or the rights of the masses
because you are not a very assertive person. Your philosophies are
pretty much centered in yourself, a live and let live
attitude. Refined tastes and a strong aesthetic sense encourage
interest in the artistic things in life.
