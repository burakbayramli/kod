Your sign produces the ultimate in energy and pioneering spirit. You
are apt to work hard for the common good so long as it advances your
own personal ambitions and satisfies your desire to be in the
forefront of the action. You are defiant and extremely
self-confident. You are sure of your manner and consequently, you
handle people with the greatest of natural ease. You love to assume
responsibility and you'll move in and take over wherever you can. This
placement blends the sincerity, directness of manner, expressiveness
and versatility of Sagittarius with the assertiveness, personal
ambition and enthusiastic spirit of Aries. Excitement, adventure,

can get in your way. Restless, impulsive or precipitant in action, you
can benefit in overcoming excitability and the decisions made to
quickly. You need to be more deliberate and avoid being in too much of
a hurry which can lead to carelessness at times. Test ideas and plans
before putting them into action. You have strong ideals and high
principles with intense convictions. You are flexible in your thinking
and you're capable of changing your mind with just as much speed as
you made it up in the beginning. You are a leader and things move
rapidly when you are in charge. A natural executive, you are never
afraid to make a decision. Moderation is the key to your success.
