You have feelings that are deep and emotionally supercharged. The
combination blends the emotional aggressiveness or intensity of
feeling and determination of Scorpio, with the emotional sensitivity,
tenacity of feeling and possessiveness of Cancer. You are proud and
aloof, tending to rely on yourself more than you rely on others, but
it is hard for you to say no and stick with no when you are approached
with an emotional appeal. Not necessarily an outgoing personality, you
don't go out of your way for others, expecting friends to come to you
instead. By nature you are somewhat demanding, even harsh, but with an
intuitive understanding of the world and of people. You can be reached
by those emotional appeals far more easily than by logic or good
sense. You are a magnetic individual, with a tremendous amount of
self-confidence. Your emotions are very powerful, your intuitions
keen, and you have a great respect for your hunches. You are
suspicious, shrewd, defensive, and in affairs of heart, very sensitive
and jealous. The danger of this combination is that you are too
receptive, too impressionable, or too easily influenced through your
feeling and sensations. There is never anything wishy-washy about your
attitudes and opinions and you cling tenaciously to your ideals,
loves, hates, and dreams. You are strongly opinionated and capable of
defending your position by argument, although logic may not be one of
your weapons in this war. Your arguments twist and turn, frustrating
an opponent who would attack your position with pure reason.
