During the twentieth century, the conjunction aspect was made during 1942 and in
1988. It offers the possibility of an effective balance between these two
antagonistic planets. Apart from those born under this aspect, the energy
released into the collective mind at these times can aid in the interplay
between forces of order and chaos, conceivably bringing the opposites into
equilibrium and allowing a space for something new to be born.

<br/><br/>

For the individual with this aspect, there should be the ability to fuse ideas
with practical application, to ground and anchor those sometimes slightly
intangible and ephemeral Uranian ideas, thus transferring the, from the level of
mind into material existence. You should be able to take advantage of your
personal resources and talents; and these can be effectively expressed through
efficient organisation. The flow of Uranian energy should seem more consistent
and reliable; and you will be able to apply persistence and focused will to
achieve your objectives. Often, you will find enjoyment from becoming involved
in situations where you can create order from chaos. Whilst this may appear
Saturnian in nature, Uranus is not chaotic for the sake of it, but is only
disruptive in order to create the conditions for a higher order to be
superimposed.

<br/><br/>

You can function in a 'bridging role', carefully restoring a balance between
order and change, and re-integrating this into a new structure which is an
improvement on the previous one. In modern life, where so many changes are
occurring so quickly, such a role can be most important, and utilises both of
these planetary characteristics in a positive way. You have a sympathetic
understanding of the past, and of the values and attitudes of conservative
stability, yet also intuit and appreciate the necessity of change and evolving
of social structures, organisations and individual development. You will try to
integrate these threads, uniting what is worth retaining from the past with the
ideas of the next step forward. Doing this, you work with both your intellect
and intuitional faculties, and so reflect the next stage in human development
towards the consciousness of unity.

<br/><br/>

You are likely to prefer a form of expression that involves a social
contribution over and above mere participation in society; you would like to
feel that you have some influence in improving things, and that your
preoccupation is not totally for personal gain. This need can often give you a
sense of direction in your life, and one which can absorb both of these
planetary energies. If you begin to feel that you are having to keep down inner
pressures of certain kinds, perhaps through a lack of channels to release them
into, then it is a likely sign that you are not fluently expressing both the
energies. Look at your life pattern and see which one is being repressed. In
most cases, this would be the Uranus energy, as the Saturn energy, which is one
of order and discipline, is often expressed through social conditioning. To free
this blocked energy, more spontaneity, more experimentation, and exploration of
new interests, would help. These would stimulate needed changes to happen, and
so break down any fixed lifestyle patterns that are becoming inhibiting. If the
Saturn energy is repressed, more self-discipline, commitment and perseverance to
achieving your objectives would help. If the lifestyle lacks control, too much
freedom could also lead to a loss of personal centre and stability, leaving you
feeling lost and unsure of what to do or in which direction to travel. You will
need to draw through the Saturn qualities of boundary-making and structure, so
that your life and inner nature begin to take distinct form again, creating a
stable foundation from which to work.
