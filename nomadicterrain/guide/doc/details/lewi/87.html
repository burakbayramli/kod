You have a highly versatile and clever personality. You have a flair
for people that makes you very popular. You have a keen, if sometimes
sarcastic, sense of humor. Sometimes you can sound a bit cynical in
expression or be too clever. Your mental capabilities are very
significant, as you have the ability to reason on your sensations. You
are an exceptionally quick and retentive learner. The depth of
Scorpio's intensity and tendency to dig to the bottom of every issue,
is challenged by the Gemini desire to always be into something new and
different, and this factor seems to generate a great deal of nervous
energy or hyperactivity. Thus, you seem to always be engaged in a
flurry of activity, constantly moving from one project to the
next. You obtain more satisfaction from addressing a wide variety of
problems at the same time rather than concentrating your efforts on
getting a single project finished right. You thrive on change and you
are rarely content or satisfied with current ideas or opinions. In
contrast with the inherently fixed, stable and determined character
normally found in Scorpio, you are much more flexible and changeable
in your mental outlook. There are periods when you are wavering and
indecisive, because of your ability to see both sides of a
question. You are clever and quick with words and you may achieve
success in fields that take advantage of your critical or analytical
and investigative skills. Success in not, however, all important to
you, as you want to just more or less just slide through life with an
attitude of indifference and nonchalance. Nonetheless, brains and
personality will usually go far even when the attitude in completely
determined.
