<p>
Your sign produces some degree of conflict in your nature because of
vast differences between these signs. The common qualities are
hardness and a true strength of purpose. Real emotions are not likely
to be common to your nature. The variance of these to signs suggests a
personality that is high-spirited, combative, and
critical. Sociability is not second nature to you, and you seem to
hold on to friends and lovers in spite of, not because of, the way you
project yourself. You are demanding and exacting; always such a
perfectionist. You have much less self-confidence than most
perceive. You express yourself in a dynamic and executive way that
makes you a strong, but probably not always the most popular
manager. Mentally, you are both thoughtful and accurate, having
piercing insights into people and situations. Being not at all
disinclined to voice your dissatisfaction with others, many will view
you as an exceptionally demanding leader. You may have difficulty
seeing yourself objectively as a sense of detachment and the lack of
emotional involvement retards self appraisal. You may express emotions
when you feel this would serve your purpose, but sentimentality and
gushy emotions are viewed by you as character weaknesses to be
avoided. You are repelled by others that openly demonstrate such
traits.

<br/><br/>

You have a great capacity in matters concerning social justice, however you need
to learn to act on them before you talk about them. This way, you will build a
stronger foundation and get ahead in life.
