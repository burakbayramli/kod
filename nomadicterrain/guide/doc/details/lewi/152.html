It is easy and natural for those born under a harmonious aspect between the Moon
and Mercury to make easy conversation, to be inquisitive and interested in the
world around them, and to express themselves well.

<br/><br/>

With the ability to make sense out of emotions and feelings, these people have
common sense and help others out readily and willingly. Need some good advice?
Turn to these people. They factor in emotional considerations, and tend to treat
you as an individual, hearing your problems in this manner. In other words, they
won't be quick to judge you. They believe that problems can be solved with
logic, but their answers are not insensitive or "too" rational ones. It is not
everyone who can call upon the head and the heart and come up with something
coherent, without dishonoring either faculty.

<br/><br/>

These people are attracted to the written word, especially poetry and
imaginative stories. Many possess talent in writing and/or speaking, as they are
able to weave considerable imagination and animation into either. Most are
wonderful listeners. They do enjoy talking, but they are curious and interested
enough to truly listen when others speak. They pick up others' feelings and body
language readily.

<br/><br/>

The trine aspect is the more dynamic of the two harmonious aspects. Those with
the sextile can call upon these traits when needed, and those with the trine
between the Moon and Mercury have incorporated the traits of the aspect into
their personalities, expressing them naturally and consistently.
