You possess an acute but disorderly mind; you can come to rapid conclusions
without knowing all the facts. You must learn to be more disciplined, to
concentrate more on details and to be more persistent with your projects. You
are very generous and optimistic though your optimism can sometimes distance you
from reality.

<br/><br/>

You have an abundance of ideas, interests, and plans for the future,
and may find it difficult to focus on any particular area. You are not
a specialist for you seek to get the broad overview, to see the whole
picture rather than closely examining any of its component
parts. Philosophy, religion, or other areas of theoretical speculation
interest you.

<br/><br/>

You also possess foresight, numerous enterprising ideas, and a gambling
instinct, all of which contribute to your success in the world of
business. However, your optimism and grand vision can get you in trouble too;
you sometimes promise more than you can deliver, gloss over important details
that come back to haunt you later, and overestimate the potential of an idea or
product.

<br/><br/>

Traveling is a great love of yours, especially if there is a mind-expanding or
educational aspect involved, and you may travel extensively in your
work. Consulting or education would be good fields for you.
