<p>
Your sign shows that you are dominated and motivated by your
intellectual interests. You are very loyal and sympathetic, but never
very romantic. When you marry, it will be for intellectual affinity as
much as anything else. A high sense of discrimination restricts you
from getting involved with anyone with an inferior mind. You are very
finicky in your tastes in matters of people, dress, food, and even
household furnishings. This sense of discrimination keeps you pretty
conventional. You have an innate dislike for anything radical or
daring, keeping you and the object of your interests very much on the
straight and narrow. You are very secure in your
practicality. Flightiness, insincerity, and frivolity, heavy emotions
or half-thought-out ideas have no place in your life. Since you think
matters through so carefully, you are not likely to be gullible or
easily convinced. You are a very socially oriented person. You believe
in preserving the law and order, and when issues need changing, you
want the improvements to occur in an orderly and gradual way,
according to the rules of the game. The revolutionary spirit is not
strong in your nature. Peace is so important to you. Nothing is worth
fighting for except in a polite and well-bred way. While you are one
to hold rigidly to your well conceived ideas, you have no difficulty
fully understanding and appreciating the ideas of others. At times,
this makes a firm and decisive course of action hard to plan and
execute. When a direction is decided, your creations are marked by
care and precision and a flawlessness that is amazing. You are the
perfectionist, always placing many demands on yourself.
