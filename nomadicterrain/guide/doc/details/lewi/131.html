<p>
Your sign produces a nature that is strong--a little bit indefinite,
but strong. This is a combination that is somewhat of another
world-ethereal, philosophical, and extremely open-minded. Your
individuality and personality is a blend of the Aquarius traits of
refinement, intelligence, and a broadly humane nature. Refined and
intelligent, this combination provides the possibility of high talent
or a streak of genius to be constructively developed. Ideas are
prolific, and likely range from the conventional to the eccentric and
the unusual. This is a position that is hyperactive mentally, but
perhaps a procrastinator. Mentally, you are a trail-blazer, but one
who definitely has a very short attention span for you apt to get
yourself involved with a wide variety of subjects and
avocations. Aquarius has very humanistic instincts, a natural
friendliness, and a talent for understanding and reading character. It
is easy for you to blend with with strangers, and dealings with people
rarely cause you any problem. Just the same, you are independent or
somewhat individualistic, and require considerable personal freedom of
thought and action. You are apt to success rather easily in business
because of a combination of traits you possess. You are people
oriented and thus, able to understand the needs of the public. You are
original and progressive in your thinking; new ideas and advanced
techniques are your forte. Aquarius is a so called fixed sign, so
there is a strong fixed element associated with your personality, a
high degree of focus and determination in your nature, giving the
tenacity to see any of the many tasks that you undertake, through to
completion. Whether you are in business or scientific pursuits, you
are motivated by very deep interest in doing something positive for
world; for improving people's lives in some way. It's important that
you stay busy with the expression of your ideas and talents. You are
best when unsupervised and independent in your work; at your worst
when required to perform any sort of routine or overly systematized
task. You're a bit on the high-strung side, and need to be sure of
getting adequate relaxation and outside activities that allows the
release of tensions. With your ability for controlled rational
thinking, clear perception, and humanitarian concern, you surely have
a lot to offer the world at large.
