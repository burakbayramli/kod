<p>
You have the kind of personality that can transmit an excellent
understanding of yourself to others around you. You relate well to
people and are likely to have the reputation for being one who is
understanding and sympathetic. Yet you have a rather objective
intellect that always seems to hold a large viewpoint. Your appeal may
be to large groups of people more than to individuals as your
aloofness and detachment draws people to you rather than drawing you
toward others. You often appear preoccupied, as though you were caught
up in many thoughts at the same time. You are critical of people, but
always in a well-intentioned way. You have a good deal of pride and
you're not one to bare your soul to those around you. There is little
that is petty about you, and you have little time for pettiness in
others. You have a way of achieving power over people, and you seem to
spend little time or effort making friends. Nonetheless, you are well
accepted for your general concern for people. With an aristocracy of
bearing, you raise people to your level, rarely stooping to theirs.
