<h3>105</h3>
<p>
You have an explosive personality that is always on the go and very
much involved. Mentally and physically you are a hair-trigger and
rapid-fire type. You're quick to play your hunches, and these impulses
are generally fairly sound. Your nervous energy is so high you require
frequent periods of rest and relaxation to avoid mental fatigue. You
accept a lot of responsibility because you don't like to see things
half done or poorly managed. You think in large terms, and people with
pessimistic attitude turn you off. You can even get down on yourself
if you don't feel you're living up to your potential. You see things
in abstract ideals and you live by your stern judgments, expecting
others to likewise conform to your standards. You are not necessarily
devoid of emotions, but you're a little short on human
sensitivities. You have a dramatic way of stating your views,
sometimes bordering on a sort of pomp and circumstance. As serious as
you are, your actions are often more reactions, based on a solid core
of common sense and your idealistic views. There is much indication of
leadership in this placement, and when others don't adhere to your
lead, you are very quick to express your righteous indignation. There
seems to be an impersonal detachment to your nature that relates on
principle and ideals rather than specific situations and individual
problems.
