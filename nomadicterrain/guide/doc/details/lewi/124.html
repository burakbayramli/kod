You have a personality that reflects less of the Aquarius nature and
emphases more of the influences of the Moon than in any other possible
Aquarius pairing. This is simply because the Sun in never really
strong in Aquarius, and the Moon is always especially strong in its
natural sign, Cancer. You are far more subjective and not nearly so
detached and aloof as the typical person with an Aquarius
Sun. Nonetheless, this combination blends the originality and
independence of Aquarius with the feelings, sensitivity and tenacity
of Cancer. You possess a somewhat restless and changeable nature
because of a deep sensitivity and receptivity to outside
influences. You're susceptibility to surroundings and associations
enables you to respond quickly to other people, as you intuitively
know when you are liked or disliked. Your uncanny faculty for
responding to others allows you to always be very popular and to have
a wide circle of friends. You possess considerable personal charm,
normally proving gracious and considerate in contact with other people
because you have a kind disposition. Social life and personal
relationships mean a good deal to you. You can be very popular in
business life because you take a personal interest in the affairs and
activities of employees and business associates. A natural inclination
for industry and persistence or tenacity of purpose in business or
profession should assure success. You have the knack for feeling the
truth about things rather than having to reason them out. Your ability
to think things through is never as reliable as your feelings about a
matter. Usually you can maintain a realistic, if optimistic, approach
to every job to decide to tackle. You think in terms of success, the
maximum, and the best that you can do. You enjoy casual social
gathering and you're always a good host. You can achieve success in
many field, perhaps as much on your personality as your actual
talents. Your greatest asset is no doubt your understanding of human
nature, and your greatest weakness may be the lack of understanding of
the complexities of your own nature.
