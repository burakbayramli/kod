You are very incisive and aggressive with your opinions. You have a tendency
towards fanaticism and often want to impose your ideas on others, sometimes in a
subtle manner and sometimes more imperatively. You will find yourself attracted
by the occult and other mysteries but it is recommended that you avoid those
subjects because they can generate certain fixations or obsessiveness. You must
learn to control your impatience and impulsiveness, to think things over before
speaking, and to respect the weaknesses of others.

<br/><br/>

Never satisfied with the face value of anything, you are always
probing beneath the surface for deeper reasons and hidden motives -
though you rarely reveal your own. You have a very suspicious, even
paranoid, side. Your mind is penetrating and deep and you have an
aptitude for research, investigative reporting, or private
investigation. You are keenly interested in the deeper aspects of the
human psyche, with a sort of "x-ray vision" regarding the inner
motivations and intentions of others. You are drawn to anything
secret, hidden, or mysterious, and may pursue esoteric or occult
studies. You are also a forceful and convincing speaker or writer,
with the ability to influence peoples' thinking by the sheer power of
your conviction.

<br/><br/>

You have a tendency towards dogma, you intensely refuse others' ideas,
beliefs and findings. It's very likely in your youth you rebelled
against the educational system through which you were brought up, and
now, you might be feeling as slow and/or somewhat stupid. But
actually, your only problem is being closed minded and a lack of
concentration. Once you can focus your mind on things that are
important to you, you will become a changed man. Because you also have
a tendency to push people away from you, you must think twice before
saying anything. You do not realize the dressing down you subject to
people around you when you are mad also causes to lose to support you
nurtured so slowly up to that point. You must learn to be sensitive on
other people's emotions as you are on your own. Another very important
lesson for you is to be able to accept constructive criticism.
