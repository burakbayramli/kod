<p>
You are an individualist, but unlike "sextile" or "square" individualist, you
are "actively" trying to be different, and project your difference with a high
nosed snobbish self-belief. Your willpower is string, however you use it to try
to correct others instead of collecting and correcting your own energies. Events
that will unfold in order will push you to make changes and will force you to be
more flexible.
