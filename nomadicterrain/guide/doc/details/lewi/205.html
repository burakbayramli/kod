It is easy for these people to attract attention of the positive kind. They
radiate charm, vitality, and enthusiasm on some level that others
appreciate. Not inclined to try to cover up their flaws, these people have a way
of presenting themselves in a straightforward manner, and their ability to admit
their mistakes and their fumbles only adds to their charm. They find it easy and
natural to get along with both sexes quite equally. They possess considerable
creative talent, but whether or not they use it is dependent on other
factors. They may take their own talents for granted and often need some kind of
stimulus or encouragement to do something with them. One of the reasons for this
is the fact that their creativity comes so naturally to them that they may be
surprised when others recognize their talents. Similarly, they usually possess
athletic ability and may need some encouragement to develop it.


<br/><br/>

Venus sextile Mars or Venus trine Mars: You are warmly romantic and
openly express your appreciation and love of the opposite sex, though
rarely in a crude or insensitive manner. You enjoy playing match-maker
and bringing people together romantically. Fulfillment and harmony in
love is likely for you because you know what you want and need in a
romantic sense and express those desires honestly.

<br/><br/>

Actively creating harmony and beauty through your work, art, or with people is
part of what you are here to do. You have developed a harmonious coordination
between the masculine and feminine energies within yourself; thus, you combine
strength with grace, power with elegance, decisiveness and effort with pleasure,
passion with tenderness and sensitivity. You have a romantic soul.

<br/><br/>

Some positive expressions of this pattern might include athletic activities that
have an aesthetic appeal, such as figure skating, or artistic endeavors that are
active, such as performing dance or opera singing.

<br/><br/>

Actively bringing people together in some way, for mutual pleasure and benefits,
is also one of your gifts.
