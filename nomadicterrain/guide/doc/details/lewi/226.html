Your attempts to assert yourself often result in turmoil for you and/or for
others. You tend to swing from one extreme to the other--asserting your needs
powerfully at times and at others slipping into a state of total
apathy. Passive-aggressiveness can be a problem in your life. Ordinary life
often seems drab and uninteresting to you and you must have something that stirs
your imagination, some vision or ideal or dream to motivate you. You have a
strong urge to act out your fantasies or to live your dream, and you will DO
things that others only talk about or dream about. Artistic creation, drama, or
other areas in which you can express yourself imaginatively are excellent for
you. You tend to either overestimate or underestimate your own power and
abilities.  You may lead a somewhat sexually repressed life although your sexual
needs are significant. You could suffer from anxieties regarding your sexuality
(probably carried over from parental conditioning around sex) and therefore find
it difficult to find satisfaction in this area. However, this tends to change as
you mature. As you overcome the urge to indulge in momentary physical pleasures,
you build the capacity for spiritual ecstasy.

You may be attracted to persons who are unavailable, perhaps because they are
already married or simply hard to reach. Sometimes you find it more convenient
to see your lover as you wish her to be rather than as she really is. You may
find that you lower your standards when choosing a lover and end up with someone
who is interested in you primarily for sex, or that the relationship is largely
unfulfilling. Disappointments in love may be frequent, although this is also
something that improves with age! You are an extremely imaginative lover, and
you frequently engage in fanciful and intricate fantasies. This may sometimes
interfere with "real life", but if you channel this energy well, it can most
certainly improve your sex life. Your imagination is powerful, but it can also
get the best of you. You may imagine complex scenarios and get yourself all
riled up about what your partner may have done when she wasn't around! --

Mars square Neptune or Mars opposition Neptune: Ordinary life often
seems drab and uninteresting to you and you must have something that
stirs your imagination, some vision or ideal or dream to motivate
you. You have a strong urge to act out your fantasies or to live your
dream, and you will DO things that others only talk about or dream
about. Artistic creation, drama, or other areas in which you can
express yourself imaginatively are excellent for you.

<br/><br/>

Work that serves only your own narrow personal interests does not satisfy
you. You may lack the competitive edge, the fighting spirit, the me-first
attitude that is often required for material advancement and success. You also
tend to either overestimate or underestimate your own power and abilities.

<br/><br/>

You are all too aware of your own weaknesses and need to develop a sure sense
of your own spiritual motivation. Then relationships with others form on
established ground of inspiration and compassion. As you overcome the urge to
indulge in momentary physical pleasures, you build the capacity for spiritual
ecstasy.
