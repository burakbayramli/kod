Mars sextile Pluto or Mars trine Pluto: You dream up creative solutions to
problems and take an imaginative, unusual approach to getting a job done. When
difficulties arise you prefer to avoid conflict and confrontation in favor of
more peaceful or subtle methods of resolving problems. Working to help others or
for a cause that transcends your own narrow, personal interests is satisfying
for you. You have an artistic flair and appreciate the colorful, unique, or
strange.

<br/><br/>

You are capable of applying tremendous effort to anything you attempt. The
spiritual lesson is to learn moderation. Moderation often means acting like one
of the pack instead of always being the leader.
