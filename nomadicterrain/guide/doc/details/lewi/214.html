This aspect indicates a suggestible romantic nature. Being "in love with love"
is a strong possibility. Natives with hard Venus-Neptune aspects are naturally
compassionate and are generally willing to go over the top for a loved one. It's
hard to say whether their expectations in personal relationships are too high or
too low. On the one hand, they tend to easily accept behaviors in their partners
that others wouldn't accept, as they are compassionate and even drawn to people
who others might consider trouble. On the other hand, their romantic dreams may
be so powerful that they are easily disappointed with the reality of
relationships. Deception in love is possible, but self-deception is even more
likely. In love, they see what they want to see, rather than what is. Feelings
of being used or deceived may come up for these people more than for
most. However, if a distinct pattern exists in their love lives that involves
them being let down, deceived or used, it will be especially worthwhile to
examine whether self-deception was at work.

<br/><br/>

The possibility of clinging to romantic delusions is very high with this
position. For example, some with these aspects cling to a romantic notion that
someone loves them when in reality that person doesn't return the affection. Or,
they may cling to a romance that has lost all hope. Another possibility is
devoting their love to someone who is unattainable or who is unable to
commit. Yet another Venus-Neptune scenario is loving someone who treats them
badly, all the while clinging to an idealized image of the partner. No matter
what the scenario, romantic yearning and longing, as well as delusion, tends to
be the theme. The expectation here is that loving someone requires
self-sacrifice. The result is an attraction to relationships that are
co-dependent and even abusive. Venus-Neptune people are drawn to victim/savior
relationships, and they can play either the role of victim or savior! Dependency
or neediness in a partner can be confused for love. In an attempt to love
unconditionally, they may too readily sacrifice their own needs and eventually
feel used.

<br/><br/>

The challenge for these people is to truly love a partner for who he or she is,
not for his or her perceived potential. Because they yearn to be loved, it can
be hard for them to see that they are actually afraid of a complete, committed
relationship. One symptom of this fear is loving someone for an idealized image
they have of that person, as they are effectively choosing fantasy over
reality. Another symptom is loving someone who is inaccessible or unattainable,
as this keeps them "safe" from a true and realistic commitment. At the root of
this fear is the awareness of their own vulnerability in love.

<br/><br/>

Venus rules money as well as social relationships, and a person with hard
Venus-Neptune aspects can just as well lose money due to the tendency to gloss
over problems. Just as they tend to ignore warning signs in personal
relationships, they can let money slip through their fingers because they
neglect to keep records or account for their belongings. They may have problems
with "borrowing from their future" because of overly optimistic attitudes. They
may continuously get the short end of the stick as they lend money to people who
never pay them back, or invest in unrealistic projects.

<br/><br/>

In square aspect to Neptune, your Venusian expression takes on an other-wordly
quality. Your yearning may be for that perfect lover whose spirituality,
passion, purity of spirit and drive all stem from the highest possible
level. Loving in such a manner would seem to remove you from the bondage of
ordinary life and transport you into true bliss. Although this seems possible in
fairy tales or movies, it's really difficult to find those elements in another
human being. You may also operate under the illusion that you must first
sacrifice yourself before you are worthy of love. It's all too easy to project
unrealistic feelings onto your lover, and it is just as tempting to try to alter
yourself to please a man so that he will love you. Whether those alterations are
in your behavior, your appearance or your attitudes, if you submerge your real
self beneath the illusions of what you feel will make you more lovable, you're
selling out. If you want to experience the ecstasy you dream about, you'll
surrender to a love which honors your real needs and learn to avoid situations
where you become addicted, co-dependent, victimized or abused. Forgiving the
shortcomings of the man you love is one thing; allowing him to deceive or
victimize you is another! Know when and how to give help, but be careful of
emotional rescue ventures!

<br/><br/>

Your projections about the man you love frequently overshadow the real person
with Venus in opposition to Neptune. Even though you may not want to admit it,
you are more likely to see only what you want to see when you're in love. That
feeling of being transported into another world when you're in love is actually
quite accurate. But it's not the guy who's gotten you there all by himself -
it's the energy inside you that allows you to soar! It's not easy to separate
your dream lover from the real person standing before you. You may always
project some of your own power and tenderness onto the man you love. As long as
you can allow the reality of the person to emerge into your field of vision, you
stand a chance of having a relationship which can truly serve both your
needs. Otherwise, you may fall into the trap of delusion, deception or emotional
abuse. Just because he's the most gorgeous man you've ever seen, it may not
necessarily follow that he is what you really need - or that he's REAL for that
matter! In all your attempts to become as beautiful as possible, just to make
sure that the right man will be attracted to you, you can also lose
yourself. You really do not have to sacrifice yourself to know love, but when
your heart is filled with love, you're willing to drop all your boundaries and
merge completely. There's a difference between a soul connection and
codependency or emotional addiction. It's drawing the line that's difficult. By
allowing for periods of privacy and contemplation, you can maintain your
connection to your own inner self, which will allow you to keep your emotional
boundaries reasonably intact.

<br/><br/>

Venus square Neptune or Venus opposition Neptune: You have a very
romantic, idealistic vision of love and may be disillusioned to
discover that no real, flesh-and-blood human being ever quite lives up
to your dream image of the Perfect Love. Though you frequently
fantasize about love and romance, you may avoid becoming intimately
involved with anyone or making definite commitments. You can be
evasive and dishonest with yourself and others, when it comes to
love. Some of your love yearnings may be expressed through art, music,
or an involvement with mysticism.

<br/><br/>

Sexual relationships tend to arouse your idealistic nature and may have little
foundation for a long-term relationship. Once past the initial stage of love
however, your imagination fuels the flame of intense spirituality and you are
capable of ecstatic insights. Mystical practices can enhance your sex life.
