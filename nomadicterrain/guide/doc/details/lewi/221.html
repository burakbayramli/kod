<h3>221</h3>
<p>
You are highly original and very enthusiastic about life. You express yourself
with creative drama, which leaves a lasting effect on others. In order to
explore your numerous creative potentials, you demand a great deal of personal
freedom from those who are close to you. You have seemingly unlimited energy
with which to pursue your goals and have many projects to occupy your time. You
sometimes become impatient because you have so much you want to accomplish and
only a limited amount of time to do so. You truly enjoy having limitless options
in your life and feel sorry for those who lead a more boring existence! Never
bored, you want to surround yourself with others who are exciting and futuristic
in their outlook.

<br/><br/>

One lesson of this aspect is to learn to be patient with others who are not
similarly inclined. Also, learn to do things in moderation. Take a vacation and
unwind from time to time. In your love life, you are impulsive and can become
restless if the relationship doesn't seem to be going somewhere. The idea that
you can grow as an individual while maintaining a partnership is important to
you. Your sexual needs are strong, and you need a partner who shares this
quality. You have inexhaustible reserves of physical energy when it comes to
sex, and you find it extremely natural to experiment and to introduce variety
into your sex life. You don't quite understand it when a partner doesn't have
the same need! To you, changing the way you make love is completely natural, and
you wouldn't have a good time with a woman who prefers to keep things status quo
in the bedroom. However, you are willing to accept your partner's limits, and
you take things in stride. An exciting and fun lover, you don't bore a lover or
get into the kinds of sexual ruts that some men do. You may find marriage rather
restrictive and prefer to enter into a more unconventional arrangement, such as
a live-in relationship. You have a wide circle of friends, and your mate must be
willing and able to not restrict your access to them through possessiveness or
jealousy. There is no quicker way to lose you!

Mars sextile Uranus or Mars trine Uranus: *You are dynamic, decisive,
and somewhat impulsive. You respond quickly and spontaneously to
challenges, and you enjoy vigorous physical activities that require
fast reflexes and a good sense of rhythm and timing. You have an
abundance of energy and vitality, and a restless desire to see
progress and change - you hate stagnation. You are individualistic and
make a good leader, spearheading new projects and inspiring others to
act.

<br/><br/>

You find yourself brushing up against dangerous situations. Spiritually you
learn from each one, eventually learning how to help others without taking
unnecessary risks yourself.
