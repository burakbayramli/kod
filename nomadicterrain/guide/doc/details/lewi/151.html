There's no shortage of imagination when the Moon is in conjunction to Neptune in
the natal chart. How this quality is used depends greatly on the other aspects
to this conjunction and the natives' level of maturity. In a difficult chart,
over-sensitivity, dependency, self-pity, irresponsibility, escapism, and
irrational fears are possible. However, most people with this aspect do not
display all or even most of these traits for prolonged periods.

<br/><br/>

There is a powerful need for a creative outlet for their imaginations. Intuitive
and dreamy, these people "feed" on inspiration. They want to connect to
something higher than themselves--to rise above the mundane. The idealism of
this position is tremendous, but it also opens them up to some serious
let-downs. These people grab onto some fantasy, feeling, or inspiration and it
takes them so very high, that when reality hits, they fall down hard.

<br/><br/>

Sensitive to a fault, they live in the world of feelings. They just as easily
feel ecstatic as they do pained by life, although these processes are very much
private matters that are not usually apparent on the surface of things. They
want to believe that people are honest, kind, refined, and good-hearted, and
they will pick up any small indication that this could be true. In other words,
they find the good in people as much as possible. They are very accepting, and
generally make those close to them feel quite free. However, the closer you are
to these people, the more you will realize that it can be very easy to burst
their bubbles. Emotionally, they can be hard to pin down. They rarely categorize
people, and they have a hard time making definite statements or
commitments. They do most anything to avoid hurting a loved one's feelings.

<br/><br/>

People with this aspect generally need a fair amount of "down time", as they are
very sensitive to all of the mixed energies of any given milieu. Stress is not
something they handle well, and their usual response to difficult situations is
escapism.

<br/><br/>

Emotional nourishment is constantly sought, and these people find it difficult
to satisfy their emotional longings. The expression "divine discontent" applies
here. Creative outlets help tremendously.

<br/><br/>

You are a sensitive soul, a dreamer, very much attuned to the world of
imagination and fantasy. You often retreat into your own inner world
in order to escape the harshness of everyday living in the "real
world". Gentle and often rather passive as well, you will not fight or
assert yourself, even when you need to. You are very sympathetic and
somewhat naive emotionally and must guard against being taken
advantage of.

<br/><br/>

The ability to empathize is a soul quality you have developed through
many past experiences. Your psychic openness and capacity to "tune in"
to what others are feeling is certainly a talent and a gift, but it
can also make you vulnerable to your environment in many ways. You
unconsciously absorb the psychic atmosphere and feelings of the people
around you, so much so that you may be unable to separate yourself and
distinguish your own emotions from other people's. You are thus
susceptible to being manipulated, especially through pity. Allowing
others to leech off of you emotionally, financially, or even
psychically can be a problem for you. On another level, when you are
not in balance you may manifest an over sensitivity toward chemicals,
pollutants in your surroundings, or even prescription drugs, and an
intolerance for any sort of noise, stress, or dissonance. You tend to
take it all in, rather than resist or maintain firm limits. You have
rather soft, permeable boundaries. When you get out of balance,
however, you respond well to subtle therapies which affect primarily
the emotional or subtle energies and thereby bring you into
harmony. Beautiful music has a healing affect upon you, color therapy,
aromatherapy, or simply being in or around water can all be very
effective for you.

<br/><br/>

It is also beneficial for you to periodically withdraw for renewal. Going on
spiritual retreats or visiting sanctuaries, even just being out in the
wilderness, are quite necessary for you at times. You have a pronounced desire
to escape or leave the world.

<br/><br/>

It is as if you remember a much more beautiful, idyllic, and peaceful world (the
womb/home) and a part of you always longs to return. Meditation and
contemplative practices can satisfy this urge to reconnect; the use of drugs,
alcohol, or indulging in other escapist strategies could be a negative (or at
least ineffective) way to try to achieve the same peace or bliss.
