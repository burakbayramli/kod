The charitableness of Moon-Jupiter aspects is here, but it is sometimes done to
the natives' disadvantage. These people want to see the best in others, and are
very quick to forgive and to accept others. Their big-heartedness, however, can
go a little too far at times. They might promise a little more than they can
deliver and although most will recognize their good intentions, they can quickly
gain a reputation for not being very reliable or responsible.

<br/><br/>

In some cases, the mother or maternal figure was overindulgent with the child,
and the natives are always hungry for emotional experiences. An inner
restlessness is present in spades, and it can be difficult to satiate. If the
mother figure was over-protective with the child, which is often the case, the
natives grow up with a feeling either that they should protect others or that
they should be protected or pampered. There can be some laziness and
expectations that others should provide for them, even into adulthood. They can
come up with ideas that are not very well-grounded, and believe in them fully,
not follow through, and then jump on a new bandwagon. They can also tend to
overstate their emotions. Often, they become emotionally "high" on something
that is unrealistic, and when reality inevitably hits them, the "low" is just as
powerful. Learning to temper their enthusiasm with realism and good judgment is
essential in order to avoid this up and down cycle that can drain them of energy
and spirit. They are usually humorous people with good hearts and they can be
quite generous at times as well.

<br/><br/>

Moon square Jupiter and Moon opposition Jupiter: You have a buoyant,
cheerful disposition and reach out to others in a warm, open, friendly
way. Your emotional generosity and lack of pettiness is well known
among your circle of friends, and people often seek you out for help,
sympathy, or advice. You are always willing to overlook others'
faults, and you sometimes overdo your charitableness.
