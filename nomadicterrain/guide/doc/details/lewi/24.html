<h3>24</h3>
<p>
You have much creativity and imagination, but at the same time it
creates a somewhat private dream life that may not have a firm grip on
reality. Taurus gives you a restful or stable internal nature, but the
Moon gives a rather changeable personality. Despite a need and desire
for sympathy and affection, you may isolate yourself from others and
maintain strong powers of restraint in relating your feelings. You are
highly sensitive to emotional matters, impressionable to love and
flattery. You are somewhat susceptible to being imposed upon by
friends and associates. Insights to people are continuous being formed
and evaluated and the conclusions formed are generally accurate. It is
important that you exercise discrimination in selecting your
friends. The passive inclinations in your nature makes you inclined to
attract imposition by others playing on your good nature and kind
disposition. You take life seriously, but view things that are going
on around you as though you were not part of the picture, and it is
somewhat easy for you to lose sight of reality. You can be extremely
amiable when you permit yourself to respond to people in a spontaneous
and natural manner. Because of this, you are a natural for romance
that is always strong in your nature. You have a stubborn streak that
can be a protective device and helpful, if you don't let it become too
powerful in your personality. A tendency toward overindulgence can
cause you some problems at times; too much worry, food, sex,
pleasure-seeking. Avoid brooding and feeling sorry for yourself. You
do much better when you open up to people and keep yourself on a
positive track.
