You have a personality that is drawn in two opposite directions. The
nature of Capricorn is highly disciplined and cautious, while Libra is
rash and impulsive. What tends to result is a rather positive persona,
with a sort of inspirational faith in your own infallibility, a bit
the eccentric at times, but generally a very amiable individual. You
like people, but the driving force in your nature may be more material
than humanitarian. You are not very romantic, and there is a
detachment about you that belies your real need for people. You are
extremely social, and like to have people around you, but at the same
time, you do not warm up to them very quickly; you are somewhat proud,
a bit suspicious, and as a result, you remain aloof. You have a talent
for mixing socially, however, and for getting along well with your
superiors using a tact and diplomacy that assures progress in business
interests. You capitalize in business, or in a profession, on
persuasiveness and a friendly attitude of diplomacy. You very much
dislike direct conflict or hostile situations, and your instinct to do
the right thing to preserve peace and order is generally appreciated
by all. Your talents also feature the ability to exercise sound and
impartial judgment, especially in a business environment; the ability
to mentally balance things, criticize and compare. There is a certain
mental foresight that lets you see the flaws in plans before they
become reality and cause problems. This well-balanced mentality is
well backed by serious purpose and thoughtfulness, a desire to get
ahead and assume responsibility. Maintaining balance and equilibrium
can prove to be the key to your success and happiness. Your interests
in business are enhanced by your ability to win others to your point
of view by persuasiveness and utter charm.
