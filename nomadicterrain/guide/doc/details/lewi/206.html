These people have an easy smile, a warm and responsive sense of humor, and a
rather easygoing manner when they're feeling comfortable. Although they are
unlikely to seek out people to help, they're quite quick to lend a helping hand
if the need arises. It's natural for these people to incorporate humor into
romantic and sexual moments, and they don't always understand more serious
approaches. They are capable of much romance, but playfulness comes naturally to
them. They can be extravagant, at times, with their pocketbook, but usually have
the good sense to stop before things get out of hand. They expect to grow in
their social and personal relationships. Stagnation makes little if any sense to
them. Their appreciation for the good things in life is evident but not
excessive. Often people with these aspects are in a position to offer
opportunities to others, usually with regards to work and career.

Venus sextile Jupiter or Venus trine Jupiter: You appreciate beautiful
surroundings and congenial company, and though you enjoy helping
people, you will rarely put yourself out too much in order to do
so. You are good-humored and generous at heart but inclined to be
lazy.

<br/><br/>

Your magnetic nature attracts others to you, and you are popular without making
much effort. Sharing your spiritual joy does not have to involve sharing on the
physical level.
