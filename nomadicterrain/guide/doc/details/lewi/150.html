You have unusual habits and original methods of implementation of your
ideas. Your sense of timing in life is unique; sometimes this works to your
favor, sometimes it doesn't. Your special rhythmic way of expressing yourself
can be interpreted as being flighty, indifferent or irresponsible by others, so
you do yourself a favor keeping people posted as to your ideas and
procedures. Your spontaneity and creativity gives your activities an exciting
carefree feeling. You may experience large amounts of emotional tension so you
should learn to relax. Of course, easier said than done. -- Interpretation from
the Indra Report.

<br/><br/>

You have an unusual sense of humor and enjoy acting a little bit crazy
or outlandish sometimes. You crave excitement and emotional freedom
and like to break the rules and take risks. Anything new or untried
appeals to you and you have little patience with restrictive
customs. You are attracted to unusual, creative, or offbeat people and
nontraditional lifestyles.

<br/><br/>

In your incarnational past, while there may have been long periods of
contentment and tranquility, there was also a time of great upheaval
which forced you to turn your back on the security and way of life you
once knew. Your home life may have been disrupted, and your inner
sense of who "family" is, radically changed. It is possible that you
were involved in revolutionary activities, or were in a profession
that was considered unorthodox or even heretical by the authorities of
the day, and your fellow "radicals" or sympathizers become your true
family.

<br/><br/>

All of this may affect you in the present in a number of subtle ways: a
deep-seated restlessness or desire to break away totally from your past, a
feeling that the rug could be pulled out from under you at any moment, emotional
impulsiveness, a craving for newness and excitement for which you are willing to
forego security or an orderly existence.

<br/><br/>

It is important for you to try to embody the ideals and unusual interests and
inclinations you have, without "throwing the baby out with the bath water"!

<br/><br/>

Women with this aspect (from the Astrology Profile for Women report): With the
Moon in conjunction with Uranus in your chart, you may feel that you are riding
an emotional roller coaster. Your highs can be very high, and your lows, very
low. Your hormonal cycles may also be rather extreme, and you might benefit by
taking a very careful look at holistic ways to handle PMS. Review your dietary
habits to be sure that you're getting appropriate nutritional support. Your
independent spirit plays a definite part in your resistance to taking on the
traditional roles of a woman, although you can be a trendsetter when you're
simply doing things your own way.
