You have charm, poise, balance and a good deal of common sense. Unless
the Sun or the Moon has some difficult aspects to contend with, you
will glide through life with few problems, because of the pragmatic
and stable physical characteristics of Taurus blended with the cool
intellect of Virgo. You have much to offer the world, but someone may
have to spur you into action. Once the inertia of getting started is
overcome, you can throw yourself into work with the greatest energy if
you so desire. You may be prone to complain about the way life is
treating you, but without some of these minor irritations, you would
coast along and let someone else shoulder the responsibility. A little
adversity is good for you and wakes you up so that you can become very
conscientious on the job. You have an innate ability, if left to your
own devices, of slipping by with the expenditure of very little
energy; living by your wits and your practical nature. When you apply
yourself, results can be amazing. A natural student, your mind is
quick and retentive. You love to read, and you can grasp and retain
material that other may often overlook. Though you are stubborn and
don't like to be told what to do, you are inclined to end up in a
subordinate role simply because you aren't very aggressive at grabbing
the reins of control and responsibility. You have charisma and
magnetism combined with the ability to see people for what they
are. These characteristics are what makes life easy for you and allows
you to become very much the opportunist who takes advantage of charm,
common sense and innate abilities to produce a comfortable lifestyle.
