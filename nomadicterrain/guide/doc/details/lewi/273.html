<p>
You are in no way a conformist, and you also do not push people to live their
lives like you live yours. You must work on outlets that are more constructive
than ones you have now, not to waste any of your energy. Unless there are other
angles in your zodiac that gives extra energy to your character, this angle will
help you if you use your creative side. Otherwise, you chose paths in life that
is always the easiest and the shortest for you.
