Your combination in many respects produces a dreamer that thinks in
large broad terms; a Virgo who consistently belies the nature of the
sign. You are capable of doing things that you probably disapprove of,
for the sake of adventure, romance, and excitement. The puritan
nature, commonly the hallmark of Virgo, may have to look the other way
while you accumulate a few experiences. You are definitely not a
classic Virgo possessing a narrow and focused mind. Many of the
thoughts that run though your head bear little connection to everyday
life. You are surprisingly philosophic and somewhat introspective, but
instead of looking inside yourself, you seem to hold preconceived
notions of what you are or would like to be. You can be so idealistic
at times that it will be hard for anyone to meet your
expectations. You can spend a good part of your life just daydreaming,
though you do possess a practical analytical nature allowing you to be
a very creative person when you decide you want to be. Your challenge
will always be to control your restlessness and concentrate on things
that have true relevancy. You can be very dramatic in all your
actions, and you likely have a good talent for acting. Your use of
body language and gestures can clearly communicate. You must be
especially careful in this sometimes, and be aware of a tendency
toward bluntness in dealing with other people. Often they will take a
tactless comment much more personally that you intended it. Human
sensitivities are something that you will have some difficulty
understanding.
