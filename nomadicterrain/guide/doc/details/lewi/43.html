<h3>43</h3>
<p>
You have a curious blending of independence and dependence, an
entwined network of contradictions. The Cancer side of you wants to
withdraw and become emotional; the Libra reaches and can remain
detached and analytical. There is a constant pull between sheer
objectivity and intense emotionalism. You want, and in fact need,
companionship. Nonetheless, it's hard for you to give much of
yourself, being sensitive and a trifle introverted. You do seem to
absorb other people with a charm that makes them readily respond to
you. Socially, you are always a winner, but more so in a large
gathering than in twosomes or small groups. In many ways, you are a
romantic. You like to have people around you, and you like to receive
your fair share of attention and notice for what you do. Yet you may
have some difficulty responding in kind. There is a strong
self-protective mechanism between you and others, and you seem to keep
everyone at arms length with a certain suspicion and analytical
cleverness. You have an innate ability to see all the strengths and
flaws in those around you, and unless you find few or no weaknesses in
a person, it will be very difficult for them to penetrate the barrier
and get very close to you.
