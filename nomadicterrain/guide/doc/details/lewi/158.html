With these aspects in the natal chart, there is an unmistakably compassionate
and understanding side to the nature. These people have a natural affinity to
music. While everyone enjoys music, people with Moon in harmonious aspect to
Neptune respond to music as a vehicle to heal, relax, and to uplift the
soul. Naturally perceptive, without even trying they tune into the feelings of
others, and the mood of their surroundings. There is a distinct emotional need
to escape into the world of imagination, and to withdraw from others at times
when they need to re-center themselves, largely because they tend to "take in" a
lot of mixed energies from their surroundings. Strong and sudden "feelings" and
hunches can overcome them. More often than not, their intuition is correct,
although their imagination is also powerful and they can read too much into a
situation as a result. Some laziness is associated with this position. This
stems from a natural timidity and sensitivity that is apparent from youth. They
may have been labeled "shy" in youth, and family members or friends may have
jumped in to "save" them from situations that required boldness or
aggressiveness. Thus, passivity was accepted and, as adults, these people are
less experienced than most when it comes to reaching out or going after what
they want.

Moon sextile Neptune or Moon trine Neptune: The beauty and harmony of
your surroundings has a very powerful effect on your emotions. You are
very sensitive and cannot stand to be in an atmosphere where there is
discord or dissonance. Gentle, kindhearted, and peace-loving, you will
give or sacrifice much in order to avoid a fight and to "make everyone
happy".

<br/><br/>

You are very much attuned to the feminine side of life, and this is
one of your greatest assets. Your refined sense of feeling, your
sympathetic understanding of others' unspoken emotions and troubles,
your receptiveness and your gentleness are all aspects of
this. Because you truly appreciate (and even idealize) women, you tend
to attract "angels" into your life, women who want to help you and who
will support you on many levels.

<br/><br/>

You also have a pronounced feeling for music, and your moods and general
well-being can be profoundly influenced by the music you listen to. You could
compose and/or play music, but this is a talent you may take for granted.

<br/><br/>

Your psychic abilities are also highly developed, and could be tapped and
further refined to the point of clairvoyance, telepathic communication, and so
on. Periodically, throughout your life you are apt to have a deep involvement in
mysticism, dreams, and inner exploration.
