<h3>77</h3>
<p>
You have a very romantic personality. You may make a career of love
affairs and no matter how dull the rest of your life may be, matters
of the heart will never be routine or boring for you. While you are
refined, devoted, and discreet, a wild love affair is well within your
capacity. Your ideals are your guiding stars, and you stick with them
no matter what. You go after an ideal with the greatest of enthusiasm
and dedication. You seem to have a tendency toward extreme excesses in
much that you do. There's a streak of pride in your nature that
restricts you from ever stepping below your natural position or
station in life. In certain ways this combination can result in a
passive nature as far as ambitions are concerned. In your career or
professional life you seem held in low gear by a force working like
the law of inertia. Both Libra and Leo are signs of pleasantry, love
of luxury, and sociability. These traits lessen motivation and to
increase complacency. You like and enjoy people, and when someone
crosses you or takes advantage of you, you're a little bewildered.
