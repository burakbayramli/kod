What people who were born with Sun square Moon in their natal charts want and
what they need are in conflict. The Sun square Moon aspect is similar to the Sun
opposition Moon aspect in this sense, but there are very notable
differences. Whereas the struggle between wants and needs is mostly played out
on the inside and through significant relationships with Sun opposition Moon
people, Sun square Moon people tend to confront obstacles that come from the
outside. In truth, the struggle is within, as it is a case of being "one's own
worst enemy". There can be a tendency to attract challenging situations into the
life as an unconscious attempt to recreate the tension of early childhood. As
well, specific habits and attitudes can hamper their progress in life.

These people generally have a need to achieve and accomplish something
important, and they act out their internal struggle along the way. For whatever
reason, these people didn't feel needed or accepted. The clash between their
parents or parent figures, if indeed there was one, made them feel unaccepted
for who they were, and there can be a very real drive to prove themselves to the
world (and/or to the parents). The parents may not have simply been opposite
personalities, as is the case with Sun opposition Moon. It is more likely that
their relationship was a continual struggle. Sun square Moon individuals
internalized the tension in the cosmic air that they were born into, and felt
out of place as a result. In some cases, they literally felt unwanted by one or
both parents. Even if the parents didn't clash, the early life was likely to
have been over-stimulating and tense, causing the child to feel insecure.

These people experience a struggle between their need for nurture and their need
for independence. When they get the autonomy that they seem to crave, they feel
unsupported by others. When they receive the support they crave, they feel
smothered. This internal clash is most apparent in the relationships they form,
especially in the first half of their lives when they may not be aware of these
patterns. Confrontations and challenges are frequent--not just with romantic
partners, but also on the job, with friends, and so forth. However, these people
have a lot of drive and spunk. They are resilient creatures who have faced
conflict and who have survived it. Although they face a struggle with
fluctuating energy, they are motivated to accomplish something. Ideally, they
learn through experience to accomplish something for themselves rather than to
prove their worth to others.
