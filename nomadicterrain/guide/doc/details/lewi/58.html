<h3>58</h3>
<p>
Your sign makes you highly purposeful. You have a strong sense of what
you expect out of life. This configuration confers a good deal of
mental ability and quickness. There is a hard inner core that may keep
you from being as sociable as many with the Leo Sun sign. You're not
the type of person that anyone ever walks over. Your reputation, and
the impression you make on others, is vitally important to you. You
make every effort to make a good impression by your appearance and
your demeanor. In this regard, you usually maintain a cheerful,
good-natured exterior that rarely exposes this inner core of hardness
and resolve. You are not exactly secretive, but subtle in disclosing
your plans and objectives, and you really have no desire to be
understood too well. You may become very depressed at times, but
you'll never admit you have any doubt about yourself or your
abilities. Your public face rarely breaks away from your upbeat
mask. You have a great respect for yourself, and you expect others to
respect you, as well. Success, in your view, depends heavily on
building up a sound reputation for integrity and reliability. You want
to be known as a person who can be trusted and relied upon. You are
materially ambitious, and back this up with steady purpose and great
will power.
