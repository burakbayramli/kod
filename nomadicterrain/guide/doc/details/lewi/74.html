Your sign produces a charming personality with plenty of independence
and purpose. Personality is your greatest asset; with Venus ruling
both the Sun and the Moon, personal charm and attractiveness become
the keynote. A friendly personality and the ability to put your
personality across makes people like you very much. The emotional
balance, courtesy and friendliness of Libra blends well with the
stability, firmness, determination, and set purpose of Taurus. You are
naturally easygoing, even slow in getting started along lines of major
activity, yet you possess ability for sound judgment that assures
practical results. You'll look for shortcuts and efficient ways of
doing things to avoid wasting energy. Despite looking for that easier
way, you have a strong determination to get the job done. In business,
your personality is a great asset as you know how to get along with
people. You avoid doing the wrong thing since you have control over
emotional impulses. The tactful handling of business contacts,
associates and partners attracts opportunities for you. There is much
sentiment or romanticism in your nature. Happiness may depend upon
assuring firm or lasting romantic associations. Aesthetic inclinations
are strongly marked, giving you deep interest in art or music. You
appreciate the finer things in life and may succeed in a cultural
direction. You have a good sense of balance or equilibrium, and
possess a deep understanding of the major principles of life. Good
judgment, with practical talent and patient effort, can carry your
far. Your capacity for mental and emotional balance assures peace and
success in life.
