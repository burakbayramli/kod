Your sign suggests a strengthening of the common traits between these
two, such as conventionality, caution, and unpretentiousness. The
blend focuses the emotional sensitivity of Cancer with the
discrimination and practicality of Virgo. You appeal to people because
you seem to have such solid control on matters; expressing the ability
to reason out with particular emotional concern and caring. You try
hard to appear sure of yourself, and manage your affairs with a cool,
calm and practical head. You don't make decisions until you have had a
chance to reflect on the situation and make certain you make the right
choice. Early on you may have been especially shy and prudent in your
behavior; seemingly unsure of yourself. Confidence increases as you
mature because of an innate desire to absorb knowledge and master
details of all sorts. You rationalize and analyze things very
well. This talent notwithstanding, your snap judgments and hunches
often miss the mark, especially when you are judging people. Yet when
you give yourself time, you are especially skilled at sensing the
needs of other people. You have a natural inclination to serving the
needs of the public in some way. You handle authority well, because
you respect principles, codes, laws and traditions.
