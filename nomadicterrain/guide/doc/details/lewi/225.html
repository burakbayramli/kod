Mars  square Uranus  or  Mars opposition  Uranus: Intensely  restless,
dynamic,  and energetic,  you  are always  on the  go.  When you  want
something,  you want  it  NOW, and  you  act decisively,  impulsively,
sometimes hastily  and prematurely. Impatient, high-strung,  and often
nervous and tense, you find it  difficult to slow down, pace yourself,
or   relax.  You   are  fiercely   individualistic  and   independent,
self-willed and  intolerant of restraints and  restrictions imposed by
others.  You  have a  reckless  disregard  for  authority and  can  be
extremely  rebellious.  Cooperating with  others  is  not your  strong
point!  You are  often brutally frank and abrupt with  people, and can
be quite impersonal when you are pursuing a desired goal. You may have
an  explosive   temper  when  your   will  is  blocked.  You   have  a
superabundance of energy  and need much personal freedom  to do things
in your own style and at your own pace.

<br/><br/>

Your life is peppered with dangerous intersections where you may be physically
injured. These very events, however, form the substance of your spiritual
path. It takes courage to follow this independent path, and effort to maintain
strong relationships as you do so. Intuition can be a great asset.
