These people can be precocious, animated, and passionate. They seek emotional
excitement in their lives. Although they often project a brave and tough image,
their skin isn't as thick as they'd have you believe. They tend to put up
defenses due to their emotionally vulnerable and excitable disposition. Unrest
is characteristic, as they are bored by routine and become easily frustrated
when life is "too easy". There's a buzz of energy surrounding them, and they
tend to meet with many conflicts in their lives. With the opposition, the
conflict tends to be lived through relationships. The passions are quite raw,
especially in youth.

If they can channel their excitable energy into sports or some other competitive
field, all the better. Although they can be amiable and interesting people,
others always seem to sense their boundaries. Something is bound to get them
worked up, and it's not always clear what that something will be. Their
bluntness can be both appreciated and considered offensive, depending on their
audience. They are eager to make a personal impact on those around them. Some of
them are too eager in this sense, and they come across as self-absorbed and
difficult to stomach. Patience is definitely not their strong point! Their
responses are quick, and they are passionate people who are usually quite
courageous although their energy is sporadic and sometimes wasted.

Moon square Mars or Moon opposite Mars: You are temperamental and
impatient and can be very difficult to live with. You tend to respond
with a temper tantrum (overt or subtle) if your desires are
frustrated. You become very irritable and bad tempered if you do not
have enough vigorous physical activities or other outlets for your
aggressive, feisty spirit.
