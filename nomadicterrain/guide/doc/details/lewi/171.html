It is natural for those born under the Sun conjunct Uranus aspect to question
tradition. These are individualists. They naturally rebel against that which is
established. It doesn't mean that they consistently break all the rules, but
they definitely do question some of the rules, especially those that simply
don't make much sense to them. These people have a huge distaste for
routine. They work best when they have some say as to when and how they get
things done.

<br/><br/>

Sun conjunct Uranus people possess much self-integrity. They prefer to answer to
no one except themselves. They avoid labeling people and are most offended when
others attempt to label or stereotype them. Although progressive, they can be
maddeningly stubborn at times. They do enjoy a certain level of excitement in
their lives, and they do accept change as exciting, and they do appear to be
quite open-minded--yet on a personal level, they can stubbornly stick to their
ideas and they will resent anyone who tries to push them into doing something
they really don't want to do.

<br/><br/>

The Sun, as the ego, meets Uranus, the reformer. The result is a person whose
identity rides strongly on being unique. Compare them to someone else, and these
apparently open-minded, freedom-loving people can quickly turn livid. This is
when these "free spirits" redefine the word temperamental. There, you've done
it--you've found their weak spot. If you place them in a class of their own, on
the other hand, they're happy as can be.

<br/><br/>

These people are inventive, creative, and spirited. They perhaps appear more
flexible than they are. On paper, at least, they are open-minded. If things get
too personal, however, they can be difficult to deal with. This is largely due
to the fact that they cling very tightly to their personal space and their
personal sense of freedom. Anything that seems to threaten their individuality
pulls up resistance in these people. Sun conjunct Uranus people are refreshingly
honest, highly independent, intuitive, and somewhat erratic or
inconsistent. They are often described as quirky, and they are nothing if not
interesting.
