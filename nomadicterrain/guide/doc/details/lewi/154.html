Those with the Moon in harmonious aspect to Mars in their natal charts are
passionate people who love life. Although their emotions are powerful and
immediate, their passion is generally controlled and directed. These people are
sexual people who nevertheless don't get carried away or controlled by their
passions. Because their emotions are strong and they know how to channel them
into constructive channels, they don't easily understand such things as "crimes
of passion", impulsive behaviors, or emotional excitability in others. They're
generally open, accepting, and natural in their sexual expression. They need an
emotional connection in order to feel complete on a physical level. People with
these aspects often have an affection and talent for sports, but other factors
in the natal chart are necessary to provide the motivation and commitment.

Moon sextile Mars or Moon trine Mars: You are assertive and confront
difficulties in a direct, no-nonsense sort of way. You cannot tolerate
self-pity or passivity, and you can be rather brusque with others'
emotional problems. "Stop crying and DO something about it" might be
your motto.
