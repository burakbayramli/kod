<p>
You have a truly explosive personality; dynamic, hard hitting,
powerful, and magnetic. Every idea put forth in the reading of your
Sun sign is intensified by the Aries Moon. Independence and
self-confidence may be so intensified that they become a stumbling
block in personal relationships, if they are not somewhat tamed. You
are an individualist first, last, and always. You are extremely
impatient with people, sometimes to the extent of being
intolerant. People may view you as hardboiled because of a tendency
for you to be too matter-of-fact. You do express yourself readily and
forcefully, with considerable dramatic effect. It's painfully
difficult for you to listen to and understand the woes of others. Yet
you can be demanding of the attention of those around you on those
rare occasions when you disclose your personal problems. You are not
an intellectual person, and you may not have even taken the time to
get a good education. In fact, well-educated and intellectually
pretentious folks are among those you find the most boring and
uninteresting. You are not impressed with abstract thoughts and ideas,
only actions and accomplishments. This is not to say you don't use
your mind. Your mind is always active: reading, talking,
discussing. When it comes to getting things done and done rapidly,
your talents can fill the bill. This position provides exceptional
leadership traits, but a need to develop qualities of tact and
consideration for the feeling of others can impede progress.
