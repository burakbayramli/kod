Your sign is a purveyor of harmony and peace. Blended are the personal
dash, optimism, enthusiasm and directness of manner of Sagittarius,
and the tact, personal charm and friendliness of Libra. Both signs are
independent, but in neither is the tendency toward perseverance very
strong. Shortcomings in this regard are well compensated by the fact
that you have a great deal of confidence in yourself and which you can
effectively reflect in your dealings with others, and a very good
understanding of people in general. Good will, a cheerful nature, and
a sincere concern for friends and family are at the core of this
combination. You excel at avoiding an argument, and when one does
break out you take on the role of the mediator. You may even sacrifice
winning your point to maintain the peace. You aren't so open-minded
that your brains fall out, but you are one of the most tolerant people
you know. Much more intellectual than emotional, little seems to get
under your skin and you slip through life pretty much a free
spirit. While you have a strong sense of pride and won't tolerate
anything that degrades or people that try to make you feel inferior,
you are not overly ambitious. Regardless of what you achieve in life,
you will probably feel content. This is not to say that you stand
still. In fact, you are probably in perpetual motion, but the motion
is not headed in any special direction most of the time. Success can
come in business simply because you have such sound reasoning
abilities, accurate perceptions, strong powers of comparison and
balanced judgment. You know how to eliminate extremes and
excesses. Social life and friends are extremely important to you, both
in a personal sense and because success and advancement are tied up
somewhat with friends and contacts. The impression you can make is
your most important asset.
