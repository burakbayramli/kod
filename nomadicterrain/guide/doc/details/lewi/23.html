<h3>23</h3>
<p>
You have an affable personality and an easy, friendly manner that
makes it easy for you to meet and deal with strangers. You know
instinctively how to get along with people. This conceals a core of
hard purpose and solid convictions. Your charming manner and pleasant
demeanor draws others to you like a magnet, and you can achieve your
ends with diplomacy and friendly persuasion. You are, likewise, very
tolerant of people and always very interested in them, albeit in a
rather detached way. Sometimes you are even too quick to trust the
untrustworthy, because you are so prone to have an initial sense of
faith in others. Few can live up to your code of treating other people
as you would like to have them treat you. Your major motivating power
or personal drive stems from your deep feelings. You can feel deeply
about things, yet because of an impersonal quality in your external
personality, you are seldom likely to go overboard because of
emotional pressures. You know how to control and wisely direct your
feelings making them work for you in human relationships. You have an
excellent, very studious mind, curious and inventive. You have an
innate ability to work well with colors and forms and may have a good
deal of artistic talent. You do not ask for much in a material sense,
and thus, you may not achieve a great deal in this regard. Strangely,
inertia can be your only enemy. You possess a good deal of self-esteem
that will aid you in attaining much in life. Though shrewd in
business, your honor never deserts you. Your friendliness and ability
to put people at ease can prove to be your greatest asset for success
and attainment.
