<h3>53</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces a forceful, ambitious, and concentrative
personality; one bent on achieving a good deal of prestige and success
in the world. On the surface, you appear jovial, sunny, full of
vitality, and always expressing good spirits. Underneath, there may be
a hard streak in your nature, a degree of ruthlessness that never
forgets or forgives an injury or a slight to your pride or
vanity. Somehow you can be jovial, sunny and friendly, yet remain so
independent and authoritative, seeking the ultimate in leadership and
prominence. There is something magnificent about your methods of
fighting, whether for yourself or for others; a scorn of your enemies
that enables you to demolish them ruthlessly, but without malice. A
detached and impersonal quality marks your nature. You are not
naturally introspective, and many of your actions are based on
instinct rather than analyzed personal motive. You have a tremendous
control over yourself, and in time, over others as well. You have a
good deal of pride and vanity that can be satisfied with personal
issues such as admiration, flattery, dress, and the like, or by the
broader method of satisfied ambitions. There is a constant tendency to
be excessive in a variety of ways. You are endowed with a very strong
will, and this will can be used in either positive or in negative
ways.
