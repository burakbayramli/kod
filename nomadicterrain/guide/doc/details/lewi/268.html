<p>
Your optimistic belief in yourself is high but not realistic. Without seeing all
the rocks, holes, potholes on the road, you have a way to set a goal that is at
the *top* of the *highest* mountain; Once you can realistically measure your
strengths, you will spot strengths that were under your control all along but
were not paid attention by the "loftier" you. You can follow the same strategy
to keep away that person who is not letting you to live your potential. The only
thing that will create a strong image for you is reality, not stories nor
novels. Diplomacy, being practical and being ready to assume responsibility for
your actions will be the keys for your success.
