You have an inner nature that differs greatly from the outer or
projected personality. Its hard to strike a balance between a sense of
inward peace, and reactions that are quite impulsive, active and even
aggressive. There is a blending of emotional sensitivity, adaptability
and understanding that is Pisces, with the high spirit and
independence of Aries. With this there is generally a strong urge for
personal advancement, fame or at least recognition, but you may need
greater confidence and inward incentive to realize these desires. You
may possess considerable ability for personal expression if you can
just make the decision to go after it. Your strength lies in your
natural love of knowledge and your urge to always be
well-informed. You are also very self-reliant; showing keen mental
ability, the ability to think for yourself. Its important for you to
avoid extremes in your life, understanding the value of moderation and
self-control. You should not neglect your need to find a peaceful
world and a calm approach to problems, despite natural tendencies to
overdo and be rather hard-driving. In many ways you seem to be very
assertive, competitive and determined, but in actual fact, you are not
really as positive and sure of yourself as you appear. In some ways
there is a good bit of bluff in your personality. You put a lot of
romance and feeling into everything you do, expressing much enthusiasm
with a most purposeful approach to life. Yours is an unusual
combination in that it possesses a rare capacity for depth of feeling,
imagination and vision, while it also features so much personal
assertiveness and and a powerful demand for independence.
