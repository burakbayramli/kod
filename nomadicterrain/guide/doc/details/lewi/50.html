<h3>50</h3>
<p>
You have a very strong personality for better or for worse. You have
the capacity to see things in the large, with a good deal of practical
idealism and a very fixed attitude. This can make you successful in
business undertakings that require foresight and executive ability. No
one ever has to wonder where you stand on an issue. Although you are
prone to make errors in judgment, you are just as emphatic when you
are wrong as when you are right. You can be stubborn and lacking in
innate diplomacy. You can learn to hold your tongue, but it's
difficult for you not to express you views with conviction. You are
utterly honest, but capable of believing what it is that suits your
purposes and supports your ideas. Making mountains out of mole hills
and always refusing to compromise, can make life a bit difficult at
times. Nonetheless, the combination is one that gets things done and
usually does it very well. In all undertakings you have a good head
for managing and controlling. Though never one to yield anything to an
opponent, you are very loving and sharing with those close to you. For
this you do require their complete devotion, eternal love, infinite
admiration, and constant sympathy. You are an earnest and well-meaning
person, but one who may need to try to become more detached and see
yourself a bit more objectively.
