You have an extremely strong inner drive and a keen sense of your own
importance as an individual. A certain rigid inner pride keeps your
self-respect always at a high level. Early on, temperament may be a
problem, but as you mature cooperation is learned and a judicial and
rather stern nature rules the personality. A very reserved individual,
you often express yourself in quiet ways, always remaining perfectly
capable of communicating disapproval without saying even a word. Most
people think of you as a very reasonable person and in may ways you
are. It is very difficult, however, to ever persuade you that you are
wrong because of a highly inflexible core within. Often you may use
the tactic of appearing not to understand the other person's point of
view, even when it is quite clear to you. You are very honorable,
loyal, and devoted, with a keen sense of the sobriety of life, and of
your duty as a part of it. Right or wrong, you hold to your first
impressions of people, especially if those first impressions were not
good. You are a very understanding of people and their problems, and
while you usually can remain very much detached, you are a good
listener and provide sound advice. Emotions never seem to interfere
with your reasoning power.
