<p>
You have a personality not easily tied down, fenced in, and one that
doesn't like obligation, duty, or possessiveness. Routine,
responsibility, and details depress you. You enjoy practical jokes and
catching people off guard. Erratic and impulsive, you enjoy life most
when it is exciting and full of surprises. This combination blends the
emotional balance, courtesy and friendliness of Libra with the
confidence, assertiveness and enthusiasm of Aries. Born under a full
Moon, you are extroverted and open. You are likely to appear more
assertive or forceful than you are, as despite personal impulsiveness
you strive to maintain equilibrium and peace; but from time to time
you cannot help displaying a devil may care attitude. You like to
support the underdog and in many ways you are a true soldier for
justice. Enthusiasm carries you along and your interest is maintained
while your enthusiasm lasts, but you can be inconsistent at times and
not finish what you start. You influence people with the intensity of
your thinking and the positive emphasis of your
personality. Self-sufficient and mentally independent, your ability to
control your emotions and feelings increases your authority or
influence over others. An innate refinement, courtesy, kindness, and
need for justice in all things, definitely favors success.
