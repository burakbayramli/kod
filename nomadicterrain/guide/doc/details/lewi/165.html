Because of their dreamy natures and big hopes, it is too easy for those with
Moon in hard aspect to Neptune to become disenchanted. In turn, it is easy for
them to be inspired once again. The result is an emotional rollercoaster
ride. These people hunger for emotional inspiration and nourishment, but they
can be like a bottomless pit in this regard. Or, their hopes can be too lofty
and unrealistic, so the undefined prize they are searching for is forever
elusive. At times, they feel very much at mercy of their emotions, yet they have
a hard time truly understanding or defining their emotional worlds. There is
much yearning of the soul with this position, yet the emptiness they tend to
feel so overwhelmingly at times is hard to define. In all likelihood, they are
searching for unconditional love--both to give it and to receive it. Yet, their
own faith and trust in others is subject to huge swings. They want more than
anything to trust their loved ones, yet when they do, part of them is suspicious
of their own trusting hearts, and they worry that they trust too much. Often,
these issues stem from a childhood in which the nurturing was inconsistent.

These people can waste a lot of time on emotional whims, when they follow
illusive or unrealistic goals and people. In relationships, quite ironically,
these emotional souls can be hard to reach. They have a hard time committing to
any one path, and they can very easily sidestep difficult issues. The avoidance
of "not so nice" topics is perhaps most prominent in men with this position,
although both sexes very often say something on the lines of, "let's not talk
about that". Facing reality and hard cold facts can be hard for these
people. They tend to glamorize their past or dream about an ideal future, and
enjoying the present is a rarity. Procrastination on an emotional level is a
huge tendency. These are compassionate souls who may nevertheless be reluctant
to get involved, perhaps because they sense that they could easily become lost
in any given cause. They are psychic sponges who absorb the emotions of
others. They are extremely sensitive to the emotional "climate" of any given
place, setting, or situation. In some cases, people with this aspect in their
natal charts project Neptune onto their environment, and thus attract Neptunian
people and circumstances into their lives. Some, for example, attract partners
who are elusive, addicted, irresponsible, or unwilling to commit. Unusual
emotional entanglements and fancies are common with this position. In some
cases, "scandals" occur in the life. Creative outlets for their powerful
imaginations can be extremely helpful, as they can provide a forum for the
emotional drama that they crave.

Moon square Neptune and Moon opposition Neptune: You are a dreamer,
attracted to the inner, mystical side of life, and may have trouble
distinguishing the real from the imagined or illusory. You do not
enjoy confrontation and become very evasive when problems in your
personal life arise, escaping into your imagination in order to avoid
dealing with them directly. You are also rather gullible and naive
about people, especially if your sympathy has been aroused. You are
very sensitive to music and can use it to bring yourself into
emotional balance and harmony.

<br/><br/>

Your sense of wonder and your openness to the unseen, subtle,
spiritual dimensions of life are two of your gifts. You are extremely
sensitive to the energies and currents of feeling around you and,
because you are so impressionable and receptive, you are influenced
(even duped) rather easily. Throughout your life you maintain a
certain childlike belief in magic and in wishing, and you tend to
escape into the inner world of your imagination (or anesthetize
yourself with movies, or soap operas, or food) when the outside world
seems either too dull or harsh for you. It is important for you to
learn to deflect negative or turbulent emotional influences in your
environment, as you tend to get "sucked in" to others' feeling-world.

<br/><br/>

The "wonder-child" aspect of yourself can be invaluable, connecting you with the
world of spirit and your true home. Along with this is a strong current of
emotional idealism and devotion to the Mother. This gives you a great capacity
for nurturing, empathy, mercy, and compassion, yet there is a downside to this:
a tendency to become a martyr. Beware of sacrificing yourself to take care of
other people or to try to rescue or "save" them.

<br/><br/>

Excessive dependency, passivity, and wishing to be taken care of are all themes
around which some of your greatest challenges revolve. Either you yourself tend
to succumb to such impulses (feeling yourself to be weak, needy, a victim) or
you may attract other people into your life who play that role. For men, this
can also lead to yearning for the perfect woman who will love and accept them
unconditionally and meet all of their needs - but who inevitably disappoints, as
flesh-and-blood women cannot fulfill that illusion for long. Women, on the other
hand, may try to be the perfect woman, all-accepting, all-giving. Either of
these can be traps for you.

<br/><br/>

You also need to be extremely cautious with intoxicants, mood-altering
substances or practices as these can create much confusion and distort your
perceptions to the point where you lose touch with your genuine mystical and
intuitive abilities.
