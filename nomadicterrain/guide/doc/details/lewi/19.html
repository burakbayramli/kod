<h3>19</h3>
<p>
You have one of the most likable personalities in the Zodiac. Others
may have more wit, ambition, or intellect, but none equal the charm
and appeal of this combination. A nice home and a close family are
your first loves; social contact and involvement, a close second. Your
keen social personality is aided by a fine sense of humor and an
easygoing outlook. This personality is marked with optimism, even if
you're up to your ears in private woes. Anyone that doesn't like you
is probably motivated by jealousy. You are expressive and idealistic,
your nature is inclined toward the dramatic and the artistic. Though
your positive attitude allows you to accomplish a great deal when you
settle down to work, when forced to face the world of fact and figures
and engage in anything that restricts your creative talents, you can
never really be happy. You can never handle conflict matters very well
as you suffer from nervous tension when placed in a confrontation
situation or hostility of any kind. Your great sense of balance and
harmony constantly protects you from ever go off the deep end. You may
have a wide range of emotional responses from rapturous joy when you
are happily with a special someone in a solid relationship, to almost
going to pieces when you are confronted by hostility and forced to
react to it.
