<h3>121</h3>
<p>
You have a quick aggressive mind, a keen sense of your own
intelligence, and a sort of judicial attitude toward the rest of the
world. You have to look out for smugness and self-satisfaction for you
are somewhat prone to have a bit of a superiority complex. You are a
very solid thinker, and what you know is usually accurate, well
thought out, and well stated. But you can be cool, aloof, and
detached, for your emotional side is anything but strong. Oddly, you
do better when you don't seem so sure of yourself. This polarity
combines the intellectuality and originality of Aquarius with the high
spirit and independence of Aries. There is a lot of leadership
potential in this match up, and indeed there is a firm and decided
character. You push issues aggressively, often with the limited
prudence or forethought that characterizes Aries. You don't like
supervision generally because of fixed and independent nature; you're
best when you can work on your own without much
interference. Although, as noted, you have a very fixed or stubborn
disposition, you readily respond to bright new ideas, and in fact, you
come up with your fair share of these, so it can never be said that
you are the least bit reactionary. Personal impulsiveness or the
tendency to precipitate matters suggests a need for patience, or
perhaps just a willingness to wait for the right time to do things
that you know instinctive need to be done. Enthusiasm keeps you on the
move, and you find it difficult to be inactive either mentally or
physically. Happiness can be increased by decreasing the demand for
total personal independence and taking time to cultivate smooth
relationships.
