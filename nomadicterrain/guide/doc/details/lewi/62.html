<h3>62</h3>
<p>
You have a very solid, dependable and salt of the earth type
personality. This is usually a materially fortunate position. Though
you may have a natural tendency to worry, you may have little to worry
about. You have a sharp mind and an affable personality that endows
success with little difficulty. You are strongly rooted in security
and appear to others to be a most stable type. Though nerves may
sometimes flare up, when you are given time to think things through,
they are easily brought back into control. You can get a little
flighty, sometimes a bit extreme, even eccentric, or at least
unconventional in your habits and general behavior. Ambition is not
strongly marked in your nature because you never seem to need it as
things just naturally seem to flow your way. You have the capacity to
stick with any job until it is done and done right. Yet you may never
be the one to initiate the big project, scheme or dream. You excel at
overseeing and keeping the troops in line. You have a way with people
because you don't "beat around the bush" and play
games. Straightforward and constant, you manage with integrity and
purpose. If you weren't born into a fortunate environment, you know
how to create one. Common sense and a wise practical bent will lead to
success in business and in personal relationships alike.
