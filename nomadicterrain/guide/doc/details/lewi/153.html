Amiability is a distinct characteristic of those people who have the sextile or
trine of the Moon and Venus in their natal charts. There is something soft and
yielding about them, and their natural charm is usually obvious. Highly
imaginative and sympathetic, these people make excellent mediators and
go-betweens. They are keenly aware of their need for relationships and for
intimacy. Whether male or female, these people have a well-developed respect for
qualities typically associated with the feminine. As such, men with this aspect
are often unusually popular with women, as they seem to be in touch with their
softer, sympathetic side in a most natural manner that takes nothing away from
their "masculinity". People appreciate both sexes for their tender hearts and
friendly, diplomatic disposition.

Unless afflicted, these aspects usually promise a good measure of personal
popularity and success. Although generally considered "lucky" with relationships
and with money, this is less about luck than it is about a certain level of
inner peace and positive energy that attracts pleasant situations. The only real
down side to these aspects is a tendency to be somewhat complacent, downright
lazy, and over-indulgent in the "pleasures" of life. If unchallenged, there may
be a tendency to expect things to come to them without much effort, perhaps
relying too heavily on charm. However, people with these aspects are often
peace-makers at heart and have an unusual ability to help and heal others.
