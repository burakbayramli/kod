Almost everyone born in the last decade of 20th centurycarries this
Uranus-Neptune conjunct. Uranus is clarity, it's volatile, carries a power of
social responsibility. Uranus is out of the ordinariness, it is oddness, it is
radicalness and progressiveness. It is unordinarily open.

<br/><br/>

Neptune, on the other hand, is hard to describe. Abstract. It is poetic vision,
a dense presence of emotion. It is secretive, takes a while to prepare. What
strong characteristic traits Uranus makes open, Neptune hides and
combines. Uranus is calm, Neptune mixes that up.

<br/><br/>

The possessor of this angle might have to wrestle between clarity and
complexity; Too much clarity makes life too unmystical and bland, too much
complexity would make it impossible to manage, the possessor will have to strike
a good balance between these two extremes.
