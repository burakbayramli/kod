<p>
Your sign produces a personality that is somewhat akin to a gust of
wind. It can be powerful and forceful, but lacks constancy and is
often subject to direction changes. Your impact on an issue can be
amazing while your interest in maintained, but you're apt to leave the
project half finished and be off to another. As long as you are
dedicated and enthused things move swiftly, but as soon as you tire of
concentrating, you move on to something more interesting and more
exciting, uncommitted and unchained by emotional ties. This attitude
may apply to people just as it does to projects or tasks, and you may
abandon a relationship without so much as a "fair thee well."  Your
circle of friends may be wide, but few are close or enduring. Marriage
is very important to you, but settling down to a stable relationship
will be difficult and will take some time. You have a somewhat
frivolous attitude about living life, and a tendency to ignore
conventions and rules of conduct can cause you to be periodically
ostracized or criticized. Your outlook is broad and tolerant, and you
are very forgiving of others for their errors as you hope they will be
forgiving of yours. You have an ability to analyze and categorize
people in a very effective way. You know how to sell yourself or sell
your product with forcefulness and persuasiveness without being
objectionable, and your ability to success depends on heavily on this
asset.
