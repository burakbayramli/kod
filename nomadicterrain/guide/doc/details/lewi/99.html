<h3>99</h3>
<p>
Your sign produces a personality that is by no means shy, timid or
backward. You will step to the front when the call for leadership is
made. You are a very adventurous person, both physically and mentally,
never satisfied to stand still in either sense. Because you are
naturally lucky in a financial way, you are never really very
concerned about security. You know how to sell yourself and achieve a
good deal of popular prestige. You are apt to see a lot of life before
you eventually decide to settle down. Variety, travel, changes, mental
stimulation, and a wide range of personalities around you are all
needed to busy your extremely restless nature. Stability is your
challenge; staying with a project, a cause, or even a person
sometimes, can be a really hard task for you. Concentrating your
efforts in one focused direction can be your weakness. Nonetheless,
your broad range of interests and your enthusiasm will allow you to
continue to be effective in working on a lot of things and making
continuous progress on all of them. Pettiness is something you have
difficulty understanding and of which are never guilty. Everything you
do is above board and rendered in a grand fashion. You rarely exercise
caution or care, never one to shy away from taking a risk, so long as
there is a reasonable change things will work out. You want to get to
the top and you very well may, guided by a mixture of idealism, faith
in yourself, and cool, practical good sense. Yours is a high spirit
and a good grasp of reality.
