<h3>54</h3>
<p>
Your sign pairs two very different influences. The warm, impetuous,
and dynamic Leo and the cool, cautious, and introverted Virgo. The
expression resulting features very strong opinions and
emotions. You're critical and accurate in thought, but often too
outspoken. Attention is vital to your happiness. You seem dependent on
praise and the admiring attention you can command, even if it's
nothing more that the sympathetic concern you can muster. Nonetheless,
you are particular about friends and let relatively few close to
you. You can be extremely stubborn and opinionated. To you there is
your way and the wrong way. You have a rigid moral code to which you
consistently hold, and you expect others to live up to these standards
as well. Though there is an underlying timidity in your nature, and an
always present need to please, for some reason your independence and a
somewhat militant pride impels you frequently to do the wrong thing
out of impish delight in watching the effect you cause. As you mature
you can teach yourself tact, but it is not a natural trait. You do
have a natural politeness and charm you can turn on at will. If you
use this to your best advantage, you can be very successful in all
that you attempt to do. You have an exacting nature and a pride that
must always be carefully controlled.
