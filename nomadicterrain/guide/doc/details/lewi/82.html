<p>
You have a basic makeup that possesses a good deal of
self-esteem. Recognition and admiration are very important to you, and
you are willing to work hard to achieve your just rewards in this
regard. The tendencies of these two signs are contradictory to one
another as Libra is outgoing and unrestrained, while Capricorn, the
great taskmaster, is restrictive and shows a good deal of
seriousness. When the two are combined, there is a lesser tendency to
direct oneself outwardly and a greater inclination toward
self-discipline. For one born under the placid sign of Libra, you may
seem hard, cold, and a bit like a machine; less than typical of the
Libra social animal. Even when you reflect your natural genial nature,
there is a core of strength lying beneath the surface, producing a
very warm and reliable personality. You come across well, though not
particularly extroverted. Capricorn seems to give Libra a high degree
of drive, purpose, and a more reliable direction. Common sense and
good judgment make you well suited for a serious approach to business
and commerce. You know how to maneuver people, not in a malicious way,
but nonetheless in a fashion allowing you to achieve your
purposes. Accordingly, you make an excellent manager. Committed
neither to materialism or humanitarianism, your drive is more likely
directed to status and a shining reputation.
