Your intense ambition will never let you stay behind of anyone or
anything. Power, in any shape or cost, is your utmost desire. But, before you
assume any position of power, you need to work on your internal control In your
youth, you were/are unsure about your internal strength/skills to reach your
lofty goals. This might have prevented you from acting with self confidence, but
experience and competition resulting in your success will help your energy to
flow in the right direction. Planing is you expertise, information does not need
to be presented/explained to you one by one. Noone can diminish your ambition,
as you progress, the internal control you nurtured takes you even higher.
