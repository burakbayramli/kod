Although their intentions are generally good, people with challenging aspects
between the Sun and Jupiter are given to overdoing things. They can easily gloss
over realistic details and get themselves into debt, overindulge in pleasures
such as food and drink, and promise more than they can deliver.

For the most part, they find help for their excesses. Somebody's there to bail
them out, as plenty of people believe that their hearts are in the right
place. Generally, this is the case, but if excessive behavior becomes a pattern,
and the natives continually face light consequences, there is the danger that
they will not learn from their mistakes and abuse the "system", relying on their
friends and family to help them out a little too often. Their reputation for
being good people, thus, can eventually be used to further their purposes.

However, many people with this aspect don't fall into the trap of losing their
sincerity. They are generous, helpful, and charitable. Still, the tendency to
live beyond their means is a real threat that many struggle with much of their
lives. Another thing to watch for is depression. These people tend to go through
periods of intense highs when they are excessively optimistic. These periods are
so marked that they seem to be unnatural and a fall seems to be inevitable. They
can make promises they intend to keep, but have a problem with
follow-through. Self-control can be a real problem. Usually quite knowledgeable
and generous with their time, these people have many talents that they may take
for granted.
