<h3>85</h3>
<p>
You are a realist with little interest in generalizations or
abstractions. Your focus is definite and highly personal. Ambition is
strongly marked in your nature. You have little feeling for right,
wrong, justice, philosophy, or other intangibles unless they touch
you, or someone you are interested in, personality. You are extremely
independent and highly impulsive. You know that you are personally a
strong person, and you have little compassion or concern for those who
are not. An understanding nature is not your special gift. A shrewd
and hard-headed demeanor is more likely to describe your
individuality. Your effervescent personality and good sense may keep
you from clashing too often with associates and friends, but you are
never one to run away from a fight, and when aroused, you are capable
of voluble and forceful resentments. You are mentally quick, clever,
and highly protective. An accurate critical mind can handle hard work
and long scientific analysis. You are ardent and passionate in your
relationships, but you're not an easy person with whom to share a
relationship. You are demanding and exacting of others, but not
necessarily willing to be imposed upon in return. Though your
temperament is rash and forceful, you are admired by others for strong
definite opinions that you never hesitate to put into practice. You
are a fighter that attacks problems directly with little concern for
tact and diplomacy. Nonetheless, you are the one people will call on
when they want to get a difficult job done, as you will let little or
nothing stand in the way of reaching your goals.
