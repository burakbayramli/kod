<p>
Your sign is somewhat contradictory and confusing. The Moon placement
suggests you are sensitive, easily hurt, and sometimes very
resentful. The Sun, conversely, shows that you are not one to be
pushed around easily, and at times you can be down right
stubborn. Usually you hide your dislikes very well and rely on
diplomacy, making it a little unclear to others exactly where you
stand or what you are thinking. You have a way of changing your
tactics to suit your purposes, and to avoid conflict. In business you
are a shrewd tactical planner who can come up with the right strategy,
often influenced more by feelings than reason. Yours is a rather
sensitive nature, endowed with an emotional side that can easily be
aroused. Your foundation and the stabilizing factor in your life is in
the home and with the family. Self-assurance, that may seem strong in
your nature, is really only skin deep. Your capacity for conciliating
different views is noteworthy, but it can seem that you have no real
conviction of your own sometimes. This is not usually the case
however. There is a tendency for you to hide your light under the lamp
shade when you need to be making decisions and taking firm
actions. You need not be such a pushover because your ideas are very
sound and well constructed. Your ambitions are strong and you never
give up on a job. Yet there is a tendency to be a little negative and
pessimistic when things don't go the way you think they should.
