Your sign produces a personality that is a delight in any social
circle. You have much to offer because you are so extroverted and
outgoing. Not a particularly deep person, you are sought out and
popular for your sympathy and warm, yet detached, understanding. Never
one to get really deeply involved with other people and their
problems, you are, nonetheless, unselfish and don't dwell on personal
matters either. This combination blends the emotional balance,
courtesy, and friendliness of Libra with a healthy portion of
originality, ingenuity, and independence brought from Aquarius. You
have splendid foresight, natural refinement, and an inspirational
outlook; a happy and optimistic personality. High ideals and good
taste in all things enable you to develop a very fine type of
mentality, with a strong and broad social sense. Yours is a great
ability to judge human character and a keen insight into human
nature. You are alert to original or ingenious ideas and can use these
to considerable advantage in your work, profession, or
business. Sociability, as an important aspect of your nature, can aid
in your advancement and opportunity in life. This is never a
superficial sociability; you are sincere and open in your approach to
other people, revealing kindliness of heart and genuine interest in
others. You possess strong and sincere urges to be of service to
others. You also possess a good aesthetic sense, and a possible flair
for creative expression. Keen intellect, with a strong sense of
proportion or balance, assures that you will be successful in
life. Your sincere friendliness and sociability encourage willingness
to serve the public and to deal in a friendly and pleasant way, even
with strangers.
