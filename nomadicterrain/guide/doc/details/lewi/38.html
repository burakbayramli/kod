<h3>38</h3>
<p>
You have a very accommodating and gracious personality. Though you
have a core of determination and purpose, you come across as a very
charming, sensitive and adaptable individual. You aren't one to take
yourself too seriously, and you are always honest and
considerate. Thus, it is to be expected that you have little
difficulty being very popular and well-liked by most people. You seem
able to handle people in a frank and straightforward manner, but
always in a tactful and acceptable way. There is a modesty and
unassuming way about you, and you're likewise impressed with other
that display this trait; perhaps a little put off by those who
don't. So you may share your inner feeling with few. Not necessarily
being over secretive and isolated, but merely selective and careful in
your relationships. Sincerity and loyalty are two traits that you seem
to possess and likewise, you require these traits of those closest to
you. You know what you want and you can be very objective by
nature. In many ways you are introspective and seem to know yourself
very well. You are impressionable, but have a good sense of balance
and perspective; a well organized and controlled person. There is a
strong material side to your nature and money may seem attracted to
you naturally. You know how to accumulate wealth and make wise
investments. Some born under this combination even become miserly,
though the appreciation and enjoyment of the finer things in life
usually will forestall this tendency.
