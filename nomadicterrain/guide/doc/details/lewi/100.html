Your personality is idealistic and very much the romanticist. You are
a dreamer and a visionary. This versatile and sensitive combination
blends the sincerity, optimism, enthusiasm and expressiveness of
Sagittarius with the emotional depth, feeling and intuitive insight of
Cancer. A desire to learn, with practical ability, suggests a
flexible, versatile or adaptable expression of talent. An intuitive
foresight guides you and may keep you out of trouble in everyday
affairs. An emotional awareness enables you to understand people, and
know what it is they want. In business, you can actually sense the
public trend or interests. An optimistic and enthusiastic nature
vitalizes your feelings and emotions, and stimulates your
actions. Because of your emotional nature you are prone to
extremes. Control your excitement and enthusiasm. Don't let emotions
distort reason as they are apt to do. You can be somewhat impulsive in
expression of your feelings or sympathies, and consequently, your
choice of friends is sometimes based on how you feel rather what you
know about an individual. You do better when you are more careful and
chose friends from those who have proven to be reliable, honest and
intelligent. Because of the nature of your Sun and Moon polarity, it
is likely that emotional extremes or a tendency toward sensationalism
can be a problem for you. You may often attempt to reach too high or
strive for too much recognition. You succeed most easily when you
combine your intuitive skills and develop a habit of steady
concentration.
