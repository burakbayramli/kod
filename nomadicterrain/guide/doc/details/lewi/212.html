<p>
You are serious and find it difficult to enjoy yourself in a lighthearted, open
and playful way with others. You rarely do something purely for pleasure, and
can be very close-fisted and parsimonious. Perhaps due to painful separations in
your early life, you are very cautious about becoming close to people and
sharing your feelings. Though you crave love and affection, intimacy is
difficult for you. You may become romantically involved with people who do not
value you or treat you well. You need to learn to love and value yourself before
you will find happiness in love.

You may find that your best sexual relationships are with individuals who are
significantly older or younger than yourself. The role of teacher is so
significant in your life that it may pervade your love life. You will need to
overcome a sense of reserve or inhibition to deepen your spiritual connection.
