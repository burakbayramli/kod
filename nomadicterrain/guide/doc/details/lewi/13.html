<p>
Your sign shows you to be a strong individual with an even stronger
and determined drive to achieve your ends. You can be very dedicated
in your efforts to further important personal ambitions. The
congenial, peaceable, and placid attributes of the bull (Taurus) are
sure to be present, but Aries provides an emotional stimulation that
makes you much more assertive that most Taurus natives. You have a
sparkling enthusiasm which keeps you on the move asserting your
natural leadership traits. While involved in an issue, your mind is
actively and restlessly searching for loopholes, weak points, or
contradictions. When you find an inconsistency in logic or in the
facts, your quickness to judge comes into play and you form a definite
opinion on the matter in seconds. If you later discover a
contradiction to this argument, you may just as rapidly drop your
position and with equal rigidity, hold to the opposite view. There are
great inconsistencies in your nature, much more that you may realize
or admit. You can be tolerant and broad-minded in your viewpoints one
minute, and totally biased and unreasonable the next. Even when you
aren't insisting on something, you have a way of making your wishes
known by a manner, a gesture, or a lack of enthusiasm that clearly
states your position. When you are directly arguing a point, you have
a way of being so plausible and apparently reasonable that you wear
down resistance. You have a way of eliminating opposition by the shear
strength of your will. The traits of this configuration are ones that
demand harnessing and controlling. If this is accomplished, there is
little that you cannot accomplish. Generally, your ability to interact
with people will be difficult, and your greatest achievements will be
realized by directing your efforts toward impersonal activities.
