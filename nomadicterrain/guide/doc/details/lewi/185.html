Those with a conjunction of Mercury and Jupiter in the natal chart speak warmly,
grandly, and rarely sparingly! They express themselves with openness and
enthusiasm (unless Saturn is involved with the aspect). They are dreamers, and
often assess any given situation with perhaps too much confidence and
optimism. They are natural teachers, with an unmistakable warmth and breadth of
knowledge, although they can also be long-winded and come across as
opinionated. The truth is, these people are simply enthusiastic about sharing
information with others. They are tolerant and broad-minded, at least in
theory. Although they may come across as "know-it-alls" at times, if you dig
deep, you will find they are very charitable souls with a love of learning...and
perhaps even more so, a love of spreading the information they have learned.

<br/><br/>

Their thirst for knowledge is insatiable, but they often gloss over details,
preferring to focus on the "big picture". They make truly exciting
conversationalists for those who tire of simple small talk. These people usually
have a lot to say about religion, philosophy, the law, education--anything that
involves the advancement of humanity. Unless the conjunction is seriously
afflicted, people with this aspect are generally well-respected not only for
their knowledge, but for their integrity. Their wit and expressiveness are
unmistakable. They are usually more than willing to lend a hand and to support
others.

<br/><br/>

People with a natal Mercury-Jupiter conjunction can be procrastinators. Although
they are never short on big ideas, the implementation of these ideas (especially
the detail work) might be better left to someone else. Routine, detail work, and
other such "mental drudgery" is simply not their cup of tea. Even so, their
enthusiasm may lead them to take on more projects than they can handle. With an
exceedingly frank and straightforward manner, these people can put their foot in
their mouths often enough, as subtlety is not their strong point! (Saturn or the
Moon involved with the conjunction will add subtlety and comedic talent). If
they exaggerate, it is likely due to their own over-estimation and their love of
entertaining others through their stories. In other words, it comes naturally
and the intent is not to deceive or mislead.

<br/><br/>

You enjoy philosophical speculation and theorizing about abstract
ideas and concepts. You are interested in the broad view, universal
principles and systems, seeing connecting relationships and patterns,
and seeing the whole picture rather than its component parts. You have
a great respect and thirst for knowledge and education, and are the
proverbial "perpetual student". You also have a talent for teaching
and sharing your knowledge, and as a teacher you present yourself as a
fellow participant in the ongoing quest for understanding rather than
as an authority.

<br/><br/>

You may become involved in television, publishing, or other fields that involve
sharing ideas with large groups of people. You excel in areas that require
long-range planning and foresight, and can therefore be very successful in
business, but you are rather sloppy and haphazard when it comes to implementing
your ideas in a concrete way. You should leave it to someone else to take care
of the details. Travel or long-distance contacts and communications will play a
large role in your life and work.
