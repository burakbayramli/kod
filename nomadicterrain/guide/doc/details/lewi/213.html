The need for stimulation and the need to break the rules with regards to love
and romance is apparent when Venus squares or opposes Uranus in the natal
chart. These people can confuse their partners readily with their on-again
off-again energy when it comes to matters of the heart. With the opposition,
this is especially pronounced--when they are given too much space, they feel
unloved, yet when they get the love they seem to crave, they can feel smothered
by it. They can alienate partners by adopting an "I don't care what you do"
stance when they feel threatened. The truth is, they do fear rejection like
anyone else, but they don't always want to admit it, and they can turn quite
cold when they suspect their partner doesn't care. The energy of Venus-Uranus in
hard aspect is embodied in the expression, "Absence makes the heart grow
fonder". When close to a loved one, they can eventually feel smothered or antsy
if the relationship becomes too predictable. They can also detach themselves
from living in the moment and enjoying the love they have. When apart, they feel
more free to love. This aspect is common in the charts of people who maintain
long-distance or otherwise erratic relationships. There can be abrupt beginnings
and endings in relationships. They are not very "good" at endings--they can
appear quite insensitive, aloof, and brusque. The "let's be friends" attitude
might hurt a partner who felt there was much more to the relationship. These
people have a disdain for conventional, traditional, or otherwise "normal"
relationships. They need to learn to balance their need for closeness and their
need for freedom. They truly detest social pretenses, and insist on being
sincere. Being well-liked takes second place to sincerity. There is a strong
attraction to all that is different, and all that "shouldn't" be done in love
and in sex. Taste in clothing and art is unusual, original, and unique.

<br/><br/>

There is a tendency to react spontaneously and intensely to others, and there is
marked emotional impulsiveness with these aspects. Their most successful
relationships are unconventional ones. Whether they do so publicly or privately,
they delight in defying convention. They tend to move on and outgrow
friendships. Some possess considerable romantic charm and humor, and they can
pretty much charm the birds out of the trees when they choose to do so! Their
love feelings are easily aroused and their romantic relationships begin with
suddenness. There is a marked inner craving for emotional excitement and a need
to feel spontaneous and free.

<br/><br/>

Venus square Uranus or Venus opposition Uranus: *Your love feelings
are easily aroused and your romantic relationships begin with a sudden
electric attraction, but they often end abruptly, and you may be in
and out of love frequently - especially in your younger years. You
crave emotional excitement and need to feel spontaneous and free, so
you may avoid making firm personal commitments. Unusual or
nontraditional forms of love and relationships appeal to you, and you
are attracted to unique, creative, or unstable people.

<br/><br/>

You tend to fall in love instantly, and you need to discriminate between passing
sexual fancy and something that can last "forever." As your intuition develops,
you will be able to identify the difference more clearly. When you "fall," that
is a good time to marshal all your respect for yourself and your partner, and to
take things one day at a time until you have forged a deep connection.
