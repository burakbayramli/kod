You have what can be described as very high voltage electricity. Not
steady smooth electricity, but rather static charges bouncing from one
place to another, constantly active. This energy can be channeled, but
not for long. No matter how hard you try, you're not apt to burn a
hole of concentrative intensity through anything. You have tremendous
mental capabilities, and the lack of willingness or ability to focus
your interest and your direction, may be the only impeding factor in
your life. You feel comforable with your abilities whether they are
with your hands or with your mind. Yet you can't feel comfortable by
yourself and if you don't have someone to talk to and be with, you're
high-strung temperament immediately takes over. You will fidget,
worry, or do calisthenics until someone comes along to calm you
down. You're an avid reader, but not an especially deep
student. Always a great talker, you are glib, facile, witty, and
clever. You have a great business or law head, since emotions don't
usually play a role in your decision making and thinking.
