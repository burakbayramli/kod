The qualities of the planet Venus are aligned with these people's egos, so that
they project the traits of Venus powerfully. Social relationships are extremely
important to those with Sun conjunct Venus in the natal chart. They are
generally charming people who possess an easy-going manner. It is generally
quite important to these people to be personally popular, to come across in a
pleasant way, and to be liked and appreciated. Sometimes, vanity is part of the
package. Venus is a peace-making, harmony-loving planet, and those with Sun
conjunct Venus do their best to seek peace and harmony. If you want things to go
smoothly, call upon a Sun conjunct Venus person to restore balance. They are
diplomatic and veritable experts at smoothing over (and sometimes glossing over)
problems. They are openhanded with others, tolerant and accepting. When
expressed negatively, they can be superficial and two-faced, and they can be
very much tied up with appearances 'their own, and sometimes others'. They might
be too agreeable, too pleasant (at the expense of honesty), and downright lazy
at times. These people have a fine eye for style and enjoy pleasing
surroundings. They generally dress well and enjoy a certain amount of luxury.

These people are gracious. They are romantic and sometimes romantically
impulsive. They tend to rely on the power of attraction to bring people to them,
rather than aggressively pursuing love interests. There is some vanity involved
here they are most attracted to people who express interest in them, or who
respond well to their charms! These are not the types of people who overtly
pursue people who appear to be indifferent to them, something that Sun-Mars
people might do. They are not competitive people in the aggressive sense of the
word, and they are not people who love a good chase. Instead, they work their
charms and draw people to them. Remember that their ability to attract others
(Venus) is very much tied up with their ego (Sun).

Because Venus rules all things feminine, both sexes with this aspect tend to be
quite attractive. Women generally find men with Sun conjunct Venus very pleasing
and charming. They sense the value these men place on the feminine. Women with
this placement possess an unmistakable and strong femininity.
