This is a rather sober aspect. Those born under a Sun conjunct Saturn aspect, in
their youth, are humbled in some way such that they do not feel free to express
their will in an outgoing and direct manner. As children, their expressions of
their ego were thwarted, which led to some self-consciousness regarding
self-expression. They were painfully aware that what they wanted, they didn't
always get. As adults, they do not feel comfortable as the center of
attention. For whatever reason, people with this aspect in their natal charts
feel the need to control their impulses. It is easy for them to assume
responsibility for more than most.

Eventually, Sun-Saturn people carve their own identity. There is a strong need
to be recognized as accomplished, but some fear of the spotlight at the same
time. These people can be hard on themselves, as they aim to achieve perhaps
more than most. The face of Saturn is generally serious, but Sun-Saturn people
can also have a hilariously sarcastic sense of humor. They are not the types to
jump up and down, dramatize, or let loose. They wouldn't be described as
"bubbly" or enthusiastic. Generally, they come across as somewhat skeptical and
pessimistic, cautious, and slightly reserved. There is a distinct streak of the
conservative in these people. Some are rigid and strict, expecting others to
live up to their high standards. However, most people with this aspect are
simply very aware that life has its limitations. They are not afraid of
responsibility, and probably take on more than their fair share of it. The best
thing about this aspect is that the serious and reserved expression
characteristic of their youth gradually relaxes with time and with
age. Sun-Saturn people loosen up with maturity.
