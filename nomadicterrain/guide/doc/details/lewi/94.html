Your sign shows honor, integrity and authority as very important to
you. You are not concerned with your popularity as long as you are
true to your high principles and honesty with yourself. This
combination blends the emotional force, determination, and will power
of Scorpio, with the ambition, shrewdness, realism, and practicability
of Capricorn. You have a prudent attitude of mind that features
patience, perseverance, endurance and determination. Business strategy
and the details of management organization come naturally to you. A
natural sense of caution and reticence marks your professional
personality, and you use tact and calculating shrewdness in handling
other people and in achieving your long-range goals. Ambition is very
strong in your nature, as is the urge for recognition and high
office. Steadfast in your opinions, you are slow to change, and you
uphold tested and established procedures. Control, management and
organization are your strengths. Your reputation for sound,
trustworthy handling of affairs is rarely equaled. You have
considerable powers of self-control or deep inward firmness of
nature. Yet, circumstances can alter your control and ability to mask
your feelings, perhaps stimulating impulsive and aggressive action
when you feel the need to force issues. You have a keen understanding
of psychology, particularly in matters of group action, control,
management and decision. You feel things deeply but manage to exercise
personal control, and your feelings and emotions help serve personal
interests and ambitions.
