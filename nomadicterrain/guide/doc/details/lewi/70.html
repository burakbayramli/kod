You have a well-integrated personality with a fine mind, but one who
is on the critical, rather than the creative side. The intelligence,
analytical insight and discrimination of Virgo blends well with the
realism, conservatism and deep ambition of Capricorn. You are your own
source of strength, moral support, and ambition. There are few who can
claim such self-sufficiency as can you. This is one of the most
practical Sun/Moon combinations in the Zodiac, endowing you with
splendid abilities, business shrewdness, a calculating and realistic
mind, and the ability to place emphasis squarely on material
values. Your healthy ambition wants wealth and power. Your ability to
organize and systematize your knowledge of business facts assures
success and sound enterprise. Your mind can exclude trivial issues and
concentrate on the important matters. You are committed to personal
integrity and people recognize this and trust you. A quiet
determination and dedication to purpose describes your resolute
demeanor as you uphold convention and follow routine. You are
independent or you dislike the restraint or control of others. Public
recognition or executive position means much to you, and you need a
high objective on which to focus your energies for major
accomplishments.
