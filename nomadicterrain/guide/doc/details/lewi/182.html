Those people born under a challenging aspect between the Sun and Neptune often
struggle with a desire to be something special or to experience something more
than the ordinary. They are day-dreamers and idealists. It is easy for these
people to trust others, even (and perhaps especially) people who might seem from
the outside looking in as unsavory types. They are looking to identify with
something beyond what is normally expected of people.

<br/><br/>

Most have in common a childhood that didn't help the natives direct or define
their lives. Perhaps the early family life was lacking in supervision or clearly
defined rules. A father figure may have been absent or distant and
ineffective. Many people with these aspects have a glorified image of their
fathers. Whether the image is very positive or very negative (or if it swings
between these extremes), the image is not very clear or rational. Whatever the
case may be, these people struggle with defining who they are. They might
gravitate towards the "wrong people", or get in with the "wrong crowd" in an
attempt to define who they are. They might be susceptible to being taken
advantage of by others, especially by men or authority figures. They can be
easily led astray by peculiar desires or self-destructive habits. In order to
add a greater-than-ordinary dimension of experience to their lives that helps
them to feel special and important, they might be attracted to Neptune-ruled
behaviors, such as secret affairs, drugs, or other escapist behaviors. In some
way, these people feel a strong urge to glamorize their role in the world. In
extreme cases, the natives are completely deluded. However, in most cases, there
is simply some confusion about the past (such as remembering childhood
experiences in ways that are far removed from reality), and a tendency to
daydream about being someone more "important" than they assume they are. They
may struggle with early conditioning that made them feel tossed aside or
neglected in some way, and certainly not directed and supported.

These people are very sensitive, especially with regards to any real or imagined
blows to their ego. If the natal chart shows a strong sense of reality and a
robust mind (Mercury and Saturn well-placed, for example), the negative
interpretations of this aspect are less extreme. Still, the natives are likely
to recognize at some point in their lives that they have a tendency to engage in
escapist and self-destructive fantasies and/or habits. It is useful to be able
to connect these behaviors with their probable source, which is likely to be a
weakly-defined ego and identity in childhood.
