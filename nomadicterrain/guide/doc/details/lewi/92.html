Your sign shows a terrific creative force in your nature. This is a
very hard placement to predict because you can be so executive and
commanding at times, and at other times your riotous emotions and
sensational tendencies take over. The pits or the heights, with little
in between, is the way that your life seems to go. Emotions are
normally the cause of these enormous changes in mood. Nothing you do
is ever half-hearted. You are very emotional, but people may not
realize this because of you natural ability to conceal or hide your
feelings. You can be very impulsive or quick on the trigger, and you
do best when you keep your impulses under direct and conscious mental
control. You have such intensity that you generally get what you want
by shear determination and persistence, not to mention a huge capacity
for hard work. You are a real whiz in an emergency; forceful and in
complete control. You have a powerful sex nature that would try to
control a partner utterly, and you may have a bitter determination to
do just that. It requires a strong degree of self-discipline for you
not to dominate all those with whom you come into contact, for the
cooperative spirit is not strong, and the will-to-power in personal
matters is great. You have a sort of rule or ruin attitude that makes
you a very formidable opponent. When your devotion is fixed, you are
capable of the extremes of loyalty. But it takes a very strong and
tactful person to arrive at this position, and even then it takes a
good deal of flattery. Your vanity is great, and you need to be made
to feel you rule the roost. In one way or another you usually
do. Relationships are hard for you because you will naturally fight
with people that are strong and have pride themselves, but you hold
those not measuring up to such a standard in complete disdain. You
have no time for weak individuals. For this you live a somewhat lonely
life, and in many respects, you are a very private person.
