<h3>108</h3>
<p>
You have a nature with much scope and depth. Your love of mankind is
genuine and deep-rooted, and you are always looking for a cause to
which you can devote your time and effort. You respond to people in
such an understanding and broad-minded way. Tolerance is so pronounced
in your nature that it can sometimes be to your detriment; you can
actually be understanding when you should be putting your foot
down. Most of the time, however, you have such great powers of insight
and of recognizing the truth. You live in a world of ideals and are
not greatly interested in things on the material plane. You are not
one to blow your own horn, in fact, it would almost seem you possess a
true sense of humility of spirit. Emotionally, you are impressionable
and romantic, and you can be imposed upon by individuals who play on
your general sympathetic approach. You are forgiving, incapable of
holding a grudge, and utterly free of meanness, spite, jealousy, or
vengefulness. Perhaps you aren't practical minded, but you do know
your own worth and you can succeed in your own way at whatever you
do. Success may depend upon overcoming restlessness and perhaps a
tendency to worry too much. You underestimate your own abilities, to
keep in the background of affairs or lack somewhat in
self-confidence. You dislike petty details and boring routine, but at
the same time you can gain most in developing concentration and in
focusing your energies on definite objectives.
