You are a very serious individual indeed. Saturn, ruling Capricorn, is
a restricting influence, a taskmaster, and an overseer. When both the
Sun and Moon are positioned in this sign, the personality is a little
on the heavy side. Although you are likely to have a heart of gold,
your nature is somewhat rigid and unbending. You demand realism, truth
and facts, rejecting anything that is superficial or
frivolous. Ambition is powerful and self-control is almost a
fetish. There is a good deal of character associated with this
placement, although you can be single-minded in achieving your goals
and ambitions. Reliability is the key, as you are ever dependable, and
people can depend on you doing exactly what you say you are going to
do. You are not one to settle for second best no matter how hard it
seems to be first and best. You are not a humanitarian by nature, and
it can almost be said that your drive for power and status make you
self-centered and perhaps even a little selfish. There is a cold,
hard, invulnerable streak in you that resists personal associations,
even as you know how to appeal to others in a general sense.
