You are capable of being a great manipulator and are often caught up trying to
make things appear a certain way. You are the one who suffers from this tendency
the most. You tend to get tied down to a pattern of endless repetition in
relationships. You have difficulty in letting go even when a situation is
painful. You are always dealing with people as symbols of others who are not
even present. Love and power become confused with one another. You have a deeply
lodged need to establish your sense of self worth. Once this is secure you can
overcome your fear of being dissolved in a relationship built on equality and
will start having more normal interactions. You need to be less concerned with
how you appear to others and more concerned with how you are. -- Interpretation
from the Indra report.

<br/><br/>

Venus square Pluto or Venus opposition Pluto: *You experience powerful,
compelling emotional and sexual attractions, and you may feel that you have
little choice or control over your desires. You have an intense need for love
and may be emotionally greedy or insatiable. Your love life is passionate and
often tumultuous and painful as well. Jealousy, power struggles, or
over-possessiveness can become areas of conflict in your
relationships. Positively, you can be unusually creative and bring about
beneficial and healing changes in the lives of others, motivated by your deeply
felt love.

<br/><br/>

Your sexual intensity can lead you into all the wrong kinds of
relationships. With a bit of judgment however, that very intensity can set you
and your partner on the path of creative expression, and can stimulate bursts of
spiritual consciousness. Allow time in between to integrate your experiences.

<br/><br/>

You are more aware of love's burdens than its bliss. You do want a permanent,
growing love relationship, but you seem to attract the type of people who aren't
willing to give as much as you need. With time you will learn the positive
meanings of love, which will be all the more precious to you because you already
know the pains. One of the things you may become more aware of as you experience
love is that your relationships reflect your own inner turmoil; as soon as you
start respecting yourself as you are now, you will find that you attract a
giving, loving person more easily. Marriage could occur out of a strong need for
financial and emotional security. Some of your love affairs could be secret
ones, possibly with married persons. An intense love affair for which you are
forced to give your all could bring about a transformation.
