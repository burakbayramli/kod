<p>
You have a personality that is gentle and easygoing, unless some way
provoked. When you are asked to do something against your will, the
nature of both signs is to resist with a great stubbornness. Your
makeup is very strong and durable emotionally. You can handle much
stress and stain in your life and always emerge from a crisis in good
shape. You are stable and decisive, and there is little that is
frivolous or whimsical about you. You don't waste time daydreaming
because you are just too practical. You may spend a good deal of time
planning or putting things together, but you prefer to deal in
tangible, matter-of-fact affairs that lend themselves well to your
close scrutiny and critical analysis. You are a dependable person to
whom others bring problems or projects and count on for help. You
actually enjoy a sense of responsibility, perhaps even more than the
recognition or power that usually accompanies authority. Security is
of the utmost importance to you. You don't necessarily want wealth,
but security of home, of position, and of a degree of prestige are all
important. You are a proud person, with a strong sense of your own
worth, which you like to see manifest in the material things in your
world . . .your accomplishments or your surroundings. You have much
executive talent because of your down-to-earth way of approaching
problems and you keen understanding of human nature. You have an
instinct for knowing what people are thinking and what they will be
thinking in a little while.
