The people of this sign are crusaders of all sorts. Emotional
sensitivity and intuitive perceptions of Pisces is blended with the
friendliness, originality and independence of Aquarius. People enjoy
your company because you are so easygoing, charming and versatile. A
cheerful outlook and the ability to make acquaintances easily usually
results in the development of a large circle of friends. People
interest you, and you possess what may be termed true humanitarian and
philanthropic inclinations. You can find success in business because
of your ability to get along easily with people and make friends out
of strangers. Despite this ease of cooperation, there is a lot of
independence in your nature and you dislike the dull and the
routine. At times you may experience sudden and perhaps unexplainable
changes in mood or feeling. Progressive inclinations and original
thought are your greatest assets. You are a dedicated person in that
you must come to believe firmly in what you are doing. Once you are
completely convinced of the worth or value of a cause or of a product,
your talent for persuasive speech and quiet persistence assures
success. Conversely, when you are less than fully convinced of the
value of a program, you are not nearly so effective. You have a very
original way of thinking and acting that combines the intellectual
with the emotional. A strong inner imagination blends your feelings
with your intellect, keeping you from being either too coldly
intellectual or too emotional.n
