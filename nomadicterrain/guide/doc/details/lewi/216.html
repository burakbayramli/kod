You hold yourself back in life and though you are kind and very patient with
others, your timing can be poor and it stops you from getting what you think you
want in life. You are always trying to reform your desires and when you assert a
want, a fear surfaces simultaneously. You give up many times, just when the
world would have given you what you were asking for. You will think about a
project and start it one minute too late to accomplish it. The difficulty with
this aspect of your character is very slow to change. When it does change it is
because you overcome your fears and your unbalancing desires. To the degree that
this is accomplished you will achieve security in life. You should get strenuous
physical exercise at least three times a week in order to have your energy work
evenly and to be in good health. 

<br/><br/>

You are very serious about reaching your goals and feel that keeping your nose
to the grindstone is the only way to do it. Hard work, persistent effort, and
concentration upon a single objective are the ways you achieve your aims in
life. You exercise great self-control, even self-denial, in order to accomplish
what you desire. You meet obstacles stoically and will struggle patiently
through difficult circumstances. You feel that you must rely on yourself alone,
that it's all on your shoulders, and you can be a harsh disciplinarian,
expecting far too much from yourself and others. Often you hold yourself back,
doubting your own power and ability. You may feel that you meet great resistance
whenever you try to assert yourself or take initiative, and that is very
frustrating to you. However, you have the power of endurance and a dogged
determination to overcome all obstacles.

<br/><br/>

Generally you feel that endings and beginnings are the pits. When you see the
end coming you resist, and when you feel some new idea about to take hold, you
resist. Your life of resistance prevents you from the rate of progress you
deserve, and you need to lighten up.
