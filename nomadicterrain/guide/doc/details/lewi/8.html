<p>
You are an individual who combines assertiveness with a strong drive
to control, improve, and revolutionize. This is a somewhat difficult
position because of the intensity of your feelings, and the only thing
that you may be satisfied with, is you. You are a very competent
person, and you recognize this as a fact. Even when things are not
going well, you are never one to become discouraged or inclined to
give up. You are always seeking a new mountain to climb or a new
challenge to meet. Change and revolution fascinate you, and you
eagerly yearn to engage in any sort of competition or turmoil in which
you can be a part. You may seem genial enough and have a pleasant,
smiling face, but somehow others know that you are not one to be
imposed upon or taken for granted. You are neither a materialist nor a
humanitarian, but strive instead for recognition and admiration. The
only reward you really seek is the personal satisfaction of seeing the
job done right or the challenge met. In fact, to you, the work you do
can be an end unto itself. You can get things done on your own, and
you are likewise inspiring to others. People find you magnetic and
interesting. Though people are drawn to you, the converse is not
always true, and you may have few close friends. Self-sufficiency and
self-respect seem all that you need much of the time. You are so
self-contained and capable that you may often fail to receive any
reasonable degree of sympathy and concern from others when these might
be called for. This is not a concern for you because, just as you are
harsh and demanding on those with whom you deal, you are just as hard
and uncompromising with yourself.
