<p>
Moon sextile Saturn: Your habits are conservative and your instincts naturally
move you toward a pattern of common sense with some emphasis on repetition of
the way things have been. Financially frugal and emotionally reserved is one way
of describing you. Responsible, cautious actions come to you naturally. You seek
and general get people's approval.  

<br/><br/>

Moon trine Saturn: You do what seems right to you regardless of what others
think. But what others think gets factored into your overall reality assessment
which in turn determines what you do. You are accomplished, dutiful and
disciplined in your daily habits. This leads to self-sacrifice without any great
fanfare. You are talented but self-satisfied and content which keeps you aiming
at the center of the road. This conservatism protects you from extremes of
action so you may not accomplish much but you are always sufficiently productive
to get rewarded for your efforts.  

<br/><br/>

Moon sextile Saturn or Moon trine Saturn: You have an inner poise and
balance that enables you to act in a cool, efficient manner during
emotional traumas and stress. You keep perspective and objectivity
about highly charged emotional issues - sometimes to the chagrin of
others who might wish that you would react more intensely. You are
quietly supportive and faithful to your friends and loved ones.
