<p>
You have a great imagination and are deeply inspired by beauty, and you have
artistic talents, especially for music and painting. You are very idealistic;
you dream of a better world and you possess a fine sensitivity for interpreting
the emotions of others. Nevertheless, your feet are planted on the ground and,
in spite of your fantasies, you will not lose yourself in ramblings. Probably
you do not have a tremendous amount of mental discipline which makes studying
logical sciences, such as mathematics, harder. You will excel naturally in
matters where you can channel your great creativity and imagination.

<br/><br/>

You are open and receptive to subjects which defy rational
explanation, such as psychic phenomena, mental telepathy, metaphysics,
etc., and you could teach these subjects to others. Your mind is
imaginative and inspired and you have an aptitude for art and creative
writing.
