<h3>86</h3>
<p>
You have a nature that is solid and down-to-earth, with a great deal
of strength, intensity and concentrative power. Your mind is occupied
with the realities and facts of the here and now, with little interest
or concern for ideals or the philosophical. Your thoughts, emotions,
plans and aims are all on the wide and sweeping scale. You think and
act in the grand manner. You attract and control people with the
strength of your personality, but you are tactful and considerate of
others in a general sense, although your goals are usually clear. This
combination blends the emotional force, power of will and
determination of Scorpio with the stability and practicality of
Taurus. There is a great deal of determination and intensity of
purpose, perhaps showing a relentless aspect to your personality. You
cling to habits and routines with great tenacity, rarely being swayed
from your point of view. Though it is difficult, you should attempt to
develop a degree of flexibility and versatility, and the ability to
relax. A constant struggle for accomplishment often causes problems
with tension.
