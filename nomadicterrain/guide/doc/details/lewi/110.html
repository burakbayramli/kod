determination is strongly marked in your nature. You have a realistic
and determined mind, and much stability of character. You believe
things will work out for the best for you and very often they do. You

continue to work toward them with a special determination. You
ambitions are deep-rooted, with a doggedly persistence of will. You
enjoy facing challenges and having many tough problems to solve. You
seldom change your mind or alter you path of progress. You are so
steadfast in your direction that it is hard for you to adapt to
changing conditions. You may lack somewhat in versatility or
flexibility, but make up for slowness in adjustment by persistent
effort and firmness of judgment. You are a conservative thinker, and
you function best in well established affairs. You have a really
strong sense of service in your nature and there is something of the
Father confessor in you. People find your judicial and calm attitude
about life's little problems very reassuring. Your criticism comes in
the form of gentle firmness and usually with a smile. Calm judgment
and realistic evaluation of conditions help you become a strong
executive or professional. You are a manager, an organizer, with solid
and practical ideas.
