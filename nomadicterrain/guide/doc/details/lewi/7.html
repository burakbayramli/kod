Your sign produces contradictions in your makeup because these signs
are precisely opposite one another, a full 180 degrees apart. Aries is
naturally independent; the Libra Moon is sometimes very
dependent. This is a difficult position presenting a problem between
the emotional and mental nature. You are ambitious and eager to please
people, with the sort of personality that seems to reach out to others
as if you are in need of reassurance and guidance. Your nature is
highly individualized, yet you are just as highly dependent on support
and sympathy. The contradiction in your nature is that you value your
freedom intensely, and while it would appear that your need for
support could even result in you being dominated by another, this is
never likely to be the case. You can ignore the feelings, opinions,
and wishes of others when you get an idea in your head. The ability to
concentrate on one thing for a prolonged period is very difficult for
you. You can be daydreaming even when by all appearances you are hard
at work. The dramatic side of your nature will always make it hard to
keep your feet planted firmly on the ground and remain totally
practical.
