You have a personality that is assertive and expressive. The emotional
force, determination and will power of Scorpio becomes somewhat
explosive when combined with the directness of manner and utter
honesty of Sagittarius. You are idealistic, with a viewpoint that is
aloof, and you live in a philosophic world of your own. You are
social-minded and eager to help others, though you are apt to find it
hard to ever get started. You are affectionate, loyal and sincere,
almost to a fault. You can do well in some idealistic sort of job such
as medicine, religion, or public service. You may be too idealistic
for business and too critical of anything that you feel smacks of
shrewdness. You are not one to compromise your ethics for money or
status gains. There is a great deal of enthusiasm or spirit in your
nature, but success may be difficult until you have learned to control
impulses that often result in outbursts of temperament, brusqueness of
manner, or tactless assertions. You react too quickly, without due
consideration and forethought. As you mature, you must study the
effects of your words on others, particularly on sensitive people, and
avoid attracting antagonism and misunderstandings. After harnessing
your powerful emotional energies, your high principles and sense of
honor can take you far indeed.
