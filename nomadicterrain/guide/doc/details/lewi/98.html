<h3>98</h3>
<p>
You have a rather warm, genial, and romantic individual. You are very
idealistic. Almost to the extent that your ideology absorbs practical
purposes. You are aspiring rather than ambitious, and you generally
look for idealistic rather than realistic satisfactions in life. You
never seem to be particularly concerned about everyday matters, such a
making a living, working under the assumption that your needs will
somehow be provided for, and usually they are. You really have too
much faith in people. Most of time people do respond to you as you had
hoped and expected they would. When they don't, however, you really
let it get under your skin and bog you down. You have so many dreams
and illusions, but you really let it get you down when people are ugly
or unkind, and the harsh realities of your environment start to close
in on you. You can't seem to handle criticism or put downs well. Your
highly romantic nature is ardent, impulsive, loyal and devoted.
