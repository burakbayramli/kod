<h3>26</h3>
<p>
You have one of the most popular personalities in the zodiac. You have
the cleverness that attracts friends and a stability that retains
them. Both signs are sociable and outgoing, and there is something
likable about your easygoing, cool headed intellect that people relate
to automatically. Intellectually you are impressive, having practical
wisdom to back your broad expansive plans. A natural
conversationalist, you are loaded with interesting tidbits of
information to share. It is surprising that you can have such a
driving personality, able to move mountain in record time under a
highly social and charming cover. Your intelligence is unassuming and
your driving force of your personality is not readily evident. This
lack of pretentiousness makes it even more surprising when you reveal
your accomplishment. Your judgment and business sense are inevitably
sound and accurate. Your fluent mental ability is underscored by a
determination to see any task through to its conclusion, a trait most
Gemini fail to possess. Highly understanding of a broad cross section
of people, you are rarely fooled or taken in. You are too smart for
most people with whom you come into contest, but you won't hurt their
feelings by letting them know they have a lot to learn. Your sense for
sociability extends to all.
