You are independent, idealistic, romantic and highly expressive. The
pairing provides the dash, optimism, enthusiasm and foresight of
Sagittarius combined with the originality and independence of
Aquarius. You have a great sense of timing and persuasive abilities
which enables you to inspire and move people, whether the topic you
are expounding on is profound or merely chatter. You have a dramatic
way of putting things that gets your point across with emphasis. You
easily become a crusader for any cause that you take up, whether it be
broad or petty. You generalize and provide a constant stream of
philosophic reasons to justify whatever moods, actions, or ideals that
may have grabbed your immediate attention. You are extremely
trustworthy and people find you so, and put a lot of responsibility on
your shoulders. Because you can manage popular feelings, you are
generally capable of getting what you want out of life. Dramatic and
artistry are your forte. You have an excellent sense of what people
what to hear and see. Assuming a leadership role is natural for
you. Even if you are not in a leadership role, you are usually able to
pull people together, and because you are so socially aware, you seem
to always do or say the right thing. You are truly interested in
people and you have a great intuitive insight to understanding a broad
range of individuals. You may be very well suited for work in
politics, public, civic or community service, or in organizations or
movements.
