Love is the force that shapes and sustains your life with Venus conjunct
Neptune. Your romantic nature inspires you to believe in the ultimate
possibilities of love, and you may have very definitive fantasies about
loving. When you're in love, your compassion knows no bounds. You may feel that
you could sacrifice anything for the man you love, and sometimes do. Yearning
for a soul mate, you expect the same high ideals from your partner, although you
may not always find them. Your emotional boundaries can be quite flexible, which
allows you to feel what others are feeling, but which can also be confusing when
you're trying to determine what's going on with you individually. You may not
always feel confident taking the initiative in love, and may spend more time
fantasizing about possibilities than you spend acting on your desires. You need
a love which honors your spirituality and sensitivity, and need to safeguard
against falling into situations which would abuse your kindhearted care and
concern.

<br/><br/>

You are very romantic, idealistic, and imaginative about love. You yearn for
your "true love" or "soul mate" and may become disappointed in others who never
quite live up to your dream image of the perfect lover. You frequently fantasize
about love and often fall in love with someone you can only love from afar. You
may avoid making a definite personal commitment. Gentle and sensitive, you do
not like to be approached in a very direct or aggressive manner. You are
attracted to those with artistic or mystical inclinations.

<br/><br/>

You tend to fool yourself where change is concerned. Thus, you are able to
drift into and out of spiritual grace without even knowing it. Don't mistake
erotic dreams for the energy of tantra, and distinguish your personal desires
from the teaching itself.
