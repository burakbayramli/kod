Your personality has a gift for duality. The Pisces symbol features
the fish swimming in opposite directions, while the twins of Gemini
are looking in two different directions. Both symbolize the variable
nature of this pairing, the tendency to go off in different
directions, or face real mental binds and problems. You may feel one
way, while logic tells you to go another way. Unfortunately, you don't
really possess the sort of logic that is normally associated with
Gemini; the Pisces side of your nature will see to that. Variable,
adaptable, changeable, and always a bit indecisive, you have the
ability to play the chameleon. Strangely, this personality can
alternate between the expression of flexibility and stubbornness, both
badly timed. You will yield when you should be firm and hold your
ground when discretion would be wiser than valor. One moment you will
be sure that you want to follow a certain course of action; the next
moment you'll change your mind even though you may have already
committed yourself to the first plan. What must be learned is that you
should not talk until your mind is made up. You truly hate to hurt
people and you will do everything you can to avoid doing this. For all
of this, you invariable do end up disappointing some. You are loved
and respected as a leader by those that work for you; but you are not
nearly so likely to be appreciated and respected by your superiors
because you are changeable and you're stubborn when opposed. It is a
good thing that you adapt very quickly to changing circumstances, for
you seem to be the type of individual that is constantly facing
difficult situations with which you must deal. The strength of this
combination is the blend of emotional sensitivity and intuitive
understanding (Pisces), and flexibility and intellectuality
(Gemini). Keen mental powers and alert senses stimulate urges to
always continue the process of learning.
