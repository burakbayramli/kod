<h3>245</h3>
<p>
This angle will provide power of concentration to its holder. However in a
woman's zodiac, this sign is a bad position in matters of health. The men should
also watch out for its effects. The vitality this angle provides will not be too
advantegous on zodiacs other than Taurus, Leo or Scorpio. Even in these cases
however, you might experience organic limits to your out of bounds energy. You
are warned not to force the limits of your "biological" mental limits beyond
what they can take.
