You are a high-powered physical and mental person. Your energies, at
times, seem boundless. This is a strange pairing of strict discipline
with bold enthusiasm and idealism. The openness and outgoing attitude
that Moon in Sagittarius brings is a fine complement to the often
morose and easily depressed nature of Capricorn, producing a somewhat
worldly-wise personality that handles self and others with the
greatest of ease. You love the camaraderie of getting together with
the gang, becoming involved in a multiplicity of interests and
activities. But success and attainment in life may depend on
development of concentration and encouragement of staying power in
maintaining your drive and purpose. You are a traveler at heart, and
your restless nature has a need to be on the go all the time, either
physically or mentally. With the enthusiasm you naturally possess,
reckless expenditure of energies can be a problem. You do have a lot
of ambition, and you can be both political and direct in going after
your objectives; diplomatic or shrewd, as well as frank and
sincere. Using either approach, you are instinctively honest and
truthful. You are a very expressive person with high ideals and a keen
sense of values. A good mentality and quick wit give you a way with
words. The development of this ability can be a major key to
success. You must be aware that your words do have impact on others,
especially the sensitive types who you may offend with your very
direct speech. Although you are a broad and inclusive person with
strong humanitarian instincts, in many ways you are a little picky
when it comes to friends and close relationships. You insist that
those you associate with be intellectually compatible, and when you
find yourself in the company of people you consider intellectually
inferior, you are not at all comfortable. Companionship is very
important to you, but intellect is usually placed ahead of
sentiment. This is a very powerful and achievement oriented
combination. It is one in which enthusiasm blended with serious
purpose and realistic understanding of values, can assure a great deal
of success.
