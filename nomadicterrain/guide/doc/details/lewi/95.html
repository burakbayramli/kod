<h3>95</h3>
<p>
Your sign may create a rather quiet exterior, but inwardly there is a
great deal of mental pressure and a constant flow of
undercurrents. You often seem to be absorbed in another sphere of
existence and above being actively involved in mundane activities
surrounding you. This combination blends the emotional force,
determination and will power of Scorpio, with the originality,
ingenuity and friendliness of Aquarius. You have a strong will and
deeply fixed attitudes and ideas. Keen judgment of human nature and
the ability to sense the motives of others gives you a very good knack
for handling people. But you can be a tough boss, for once you lose
respect for someone's ability to think and reason, you have little use
for them in any way. Never showing this outwardly, you can always be
polite and civil, while feeling nothing but scorn and disgust. You
don't believe in discriminating against anyone, so you hide the
intolerance you can not help but feel. You have a need for adulation,
but unless you feel that you deserve it, you resent people that
flatter and compliment you. You have the ability to influence people
and as you progress up the ladder, you are apt to become surrounded by
"yes men", for whom you can hold no respect. Shallowness or
superficiality completely throw you off. You have a profound mind that
is broad and tolerant (at least in theory), and quite creative. Pride
is strongly marked in your nature, and you set great store by
intellectual and artistic accomplishment. There is a depth to your
nature and your emotions that few can understand. You're outstanding
at observation, at analysis, at imagining and creating.
