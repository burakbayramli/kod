Your mind is very profound, subtle, persuasive and prone to extremes. You are
very persistent and tenacious in your purposes, and you are fascinated by the
unknown or inexplicable. It is probable that you hold on to your ideas with a
certain fanaticism and inflexibility. Your verbal aggressiveness can lead to
arguments and disagreements with your companions. Nevertheless, you will be very
convincing and you could excel in investigations, chemistry, surgery or
explorations.

<br/><br/>

Suspicious that appearances are superficial and masking the "real
nitty-gritty", you are always probing beneath the surface to uncover
the deeper, hidden aspects of a matter. You are interested in anything
secret or mysterious. You have great powers of concentration and a
penetrating mind, with an aptitude for research, investigative
reporting, or detective work. You are also keenly observant and seem
to have "x-ray vision" regarding the inner motivations and intentions
of other people. You could make an excellent psychotherapist,
uncovering the deeper causes and roots of a person's emotional
problems. You may also be drawn to esoteric or occult studies and the
development of unusual mental powers. Stories of mystery, intrigue,
espionage, etc. fascinate you.
