Your Sun in Scorpio and Moon in Leo creates a strong, positive personality, with
fixed opinions and fixed emotions. If you don't let your intense emotions
completely take over, you will become a person of considerable influence and
importance within your circle. The blend combines the emotional force, power of
will and determination of Scorpio, with the pride, dignity and authoritativeness
of Leo. Certainly the two will naturally produce a very strong character and a
personality that is full of personal confidence, persistence, determination and
courage. Your weakness may be that your feelings and passions are a little too
strong, requiring rigid control at all times. You have a complex set of ideals
that you strive for, and you're a very passionate person in many ways. You have
a rather idealistic view of love and romance, and in fact, most of your other
interpersonal relationships. You are a bit harsh on your partner, or just about
anyone else, when they show weakness or human frailties. Integrity and character
are all important; you expect a great deal in this regard from everyone to whom
you are close, and especially from yourself. You have a great deal of pride and
consequently a strong ambition for high and authoritative position in life. You
have a keen ability to analyze which can help you in may different businesses or
professions. Your enthusiasm, spirit and flare for showmanship permit you to
succeed at just about whatever it is you choose to do.
