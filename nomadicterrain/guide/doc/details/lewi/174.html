Endowed with generosity and friendliness, these people appear to be lucky in
life. They attract good things with a positive frame of mind and a charitable
disposition. Rarely entirely "down and out", people with Sun in harmonious
aspect to Jupiter are usually well-received, helpful, and well-informed. They
may enjoy travel and have a special affection for foreign places and
people. They're generally not very competitive people, and for the most part not
combative either. As a result, they are usually well-liked.

These people are usually good-hearted with strong morals and much faith in life
and in people. They prefer to find good in situations and in people. They don't
have a lot of patience with those who break the rules, as they generally believe
in order, equality, and the law. They generally make good on their promises, and
the sincerity they exude can be trusted. Looking on the bright side is their
forte--turn to these people for a pleasing dose of faith and optimism. They are
quick to chuckle and can't resist any appeal to their sense of humor. Some
people with this aspect are downright jolly. Others are less conspicuous, but
their faith in life and willingness to find humor in life are nevertheless
obvious.
