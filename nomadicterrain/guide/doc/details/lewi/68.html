You are one that looks and acts like an intellectual, but with an
emotional nature that is truly the driving force. This is perhaps the
most emotional of the quiet Virgo breed. The quick mind and common
sense that is so notable in all with Virgo Sun, is charged with an
intense rashness and impulsiveness common to Scorpio. Your ability to
reason and rationalize is well developed, but you often seem almost
incapable of believing what is foreign to your internal emotional
bias. Thus, you become very partisan in whatever causes or ideas light
you fire. These you may rationalize and try to give intellectual
status, but you usually color judgments with intuition rather than
logic. You are facile at thinking up reasons why your ideas are right
and always persuasive at putting them across. At times you appear near
genius, and at other times, way off base. You are often to be found
among the theoretical and radical thinkers, able to prove nearly
anything on paper with diagrams to show how it should work. Whether it
really will or not in real life may be another thing. Your
intellectual powers are strong, but you're often less than
realistic. You have a certain zeal that makes it hard for you to
remain still and listen to what others have to say, and you can be
dominating in your approach to group endeavors. Underneath, you have a
somewhat brooding personality that is forever probing, turning over
stones and delving for ideas with which you can either feel affinity
or enmity. In business you are likely to be successful and valuable to
your employer because you do possess powerful leadership qualities. In
this environment you seem to become more objective and less
emotional. Nonetheless, learning to restrain the natural tendencies of
this configuration will make life and relationships much easier.
