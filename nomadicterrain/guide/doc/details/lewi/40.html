<h3>40</h3>
<p>
You have a double dose of Cancer, intensifies the natural traits of
the sign and produces an added depth of feelings. You are an extremely
emotional and timid person. There is an aloofness about your nature,
as though you were waiting in the background for someone to make the
first move to establish a relationship. Since most people are caught
up in their own problems and often fail to understand this nature, you
may feel that you are being ignored and snubbed. It's hard for you to
come out of yourself and meet people halfway. It's not that you are
self-centered, but you may give the impression that you are by not
coming across positively. You are so self-protective and seem to have
a shell that you crawl into periodically, or even permanently, as a
defense against the intrusions of the world. You are touchy with a
keen sense of injury and hurt at real or imagined offenses. You can be
very suspicious of people and their motives that can make you
unapproachable to many. It takes a long time for someone to win your
confidence. Though you are extremely domestic and a very protective
parent, you're not likely to marry early and your basic nature can
make it hard to achieve a stable and concrete relationship. But when
you finally put aside this self-protective shell, you are
exceptionally warm and genial, a true old-fashioned romantic. You have
a deep sense and sympathy and a need for the same. A clever diplomat,
your style is to work around an issue, rarely becoming confrontational
and direct.
