<h3>56</h3>
<p>
You have a vital and highly charged temperament. Passion and temper
have to be controlled and directed for you to achieve the high
potential offered by this placement, for it is a very dynamic and
powerful combination indeed. There is a natural tendency for you to
become very emotional and personally involved in problems or debates;
it may be an understatement to say that your likes and dislikes are
well-defined. Sometimes a bit of ranting and raging can result if you
fail to keep a tight lid on your natural inclinations. Your success
and happiness may depend on maintaining full control over your
emotions and feelings, and directing your energies along constructive
lines. A natural magnetism permits you to achieve a much success as a
leader, but there is likely to be much more emotionalism than mental
depth in your makeup. Yours is a very confident and positive nature,
revealing considerable pride and self-regard. You don't seem to rely
on logic, intuition, or reason, but instead you react on pure
instinct. High in moral attitudes, you draw the line on others
quickly, and too readily judge others on your stated standards, which
you may not always live up to yourself. Everything is colored by your
personal biases, and you have little capacity for objectivity or
detachment. This is a very driving placement, bent on getting power
and authority, and very capable of fulfilling these objectives. In
business or executive affairs you are keenly alert to your interests,
aggressive, vigilant and determined. You act on ideas quickly and
without hesitation. You are determined and shrewd. You are essentially
dramatic, with yourself being the main character occupying center
stage.
