People with these aspects in their natal chart are studies in
contradiction. When they are able to fulfill their emotional needs for
closeness, support, and intimacy, another part of their personality rebels. They
feel closed in, restricted, and uncomfortable with feelings of
dependency. However, when they are left alone on an emotional level, they can
feel left out. They begin to crave closeness and intimacy once again. They keep
people at an emotional arm's length often enough, yet struggle with their
emotional independence.

<br/><br/>

Daily routines feel too stifling for these individuals. They need to mix things
up in order to feel creative and emotionally vital. Inconsistency is a result,
and some level of domestic disorder is almost a guarantee. Living with them can
be challenging for more orderly and systematic people!

<br/><br/>

People with Moon-Uranus hard aspects despise emotional pretense. They are
adamant about expressing themselves honestly, which generally translates to
"sporadically". If they don't "feel it", they simply won't do it. It can be
challenging to pin them down at times--they will feel cornered. Don't take it
too personally, however, because they not only rebel against your schedules,
they rebel against their own as well! The fact is, when they try to bring more
order to their lives, it can be hard to stick to a program, even if they were
the ones who designed the program.

<br/><br/>

Their insistence on following their own intuition and "inner code" is admirable
on one hand. In fact, they are generally quite proud of their emotional
honesty. However, this honesty can be difficult for others to deal with at
times. They are sometimes accused of selfishness as a result, although they
don't see it that way at all. They are generally very creative people, although
their creative output is sporadic. Whenever Uranus is strongly connected to a
personal planet in the natal chart, you'll find this "stop-and-start" energy
simply because these people live on intuition. Uranus intuition is not the same
as Neptune intuition--it's more self-focused and has to do with being true to
oneself.

<br/><br/>

More often than not, Moon-Uranus people had unusual early home lives. They may
have been given an unusual amount of freedom as a child, or the
converse. Whichever was the case, they insist upon a certain level of personal
freedom as adults. Their experience of their mother figure may have also been
erratic in the expression of nurture.

<br/><br/>

These people attract changes and disruptions into their domestic lives. They may
not enjoy this fact, but if this is the case, they must examine their lives a
little more closely. Consider a person who thinks to himself, "hey, my life has
become pretty routine--even boring" and then shortly thereafter his life takes a
sharp turn. The crises that he now faces may not seem like something he has
literally asked for. However, with the Moon in hard aspect to Uranus, the basic
energy is a basic need for emotional excitement. We may live with this basic
need and not even recognize it. If we don't own it, we can attract upsetting
emotional situations and disruptions into our lives. It's hard to know whether
Moon-Uranus people embrace changes (these ones move house often, re-arrange
their homes frequently, mix up their domestic routines every once in a while,
and so forth) or resist them stubbornly. One thing is certain, however: the
happiest people with this natal chart aspect recognize their need to do things
differently with regards to how they approach family and home life.

<br/><br/>

Moon square Uranus and Moon opposition Uranus: You crave excitement,
change, and discovery, and cannot tolerate a routine or lifestyle that
offers little in the way of surprise or challenge. Excitable,
spontaneous, and enthusiastic about anything new, you may be perceived
by others as being too impulsive, especially in personal
relationships. It is not easy for you to make or keep commitments,
since you don't know how you will be feeling from one day to the
next. Emotional freedom is very important to you. Your domestic life
can be very unstable - but you like it that way.

<br/><br/>

In your incarnational past there was a great deal of upheaval and
sudden change, possibly precipitated by political or social
shifts. You were forced to choose between your home and all that was
familiar, versus freedom or your ideals. You became very adaptable,
living moment to moment, and there was very little of a solid,
enduring home-base. You lived a somewhat unorthodox and unpredictable
life which, while insecure and uncertain in many respects, did afford
you a lot of freedom and wild adventures. (The pattern of frequent
change, movement and upsets in the home may or may not have been
repeated early in your current life).

<br/><br/>

The carry over from that time into the present is a peculiar, emotional
excitability and a highly, restless emotional state which at times can lead to
extreme nervous strain and exhaustion. Along with this is a craving for
stimulation and a taste for the new, bizarre, even perverse. You may feel that
you were not meant for a "straight", conventional, tranquil existence, even if
you long at times for the comforts such a lifestyle seems to provide. A desire
for total emotional freedom and release from past conditioning and inhibitions
may compel you to make a nearly-total break from your family or heritage, to the
point of adopting a new name, religion, or lifestyle than the one you were
raised with. All of this may serve you well - to a point. Beware, however, of
becoming an extremist and trying to rid yourself of everything in your past,
"throwing the baby out with the bath water" so to speak, as this will cut you
off from important aspects of yourself.

<br/><br/>

This urge for emotional freedom and excitement can also interfere with your
establishment of deep, ongoing relationships. You fear being trapped in monotony
and boredom if you commit yourself to a permanent relationship. Any long-term
relationship you form must have a lot of personal space and room to change and
to be spontaneous.

<br/><br/>

When out of balance you can become very ungrounded and are prone to emotional
swings. Positively, you can be very inspired, musically or artistically or in
other ways. When balanced you have a great sense of rhythm, and your spontaneous
intuitive insights and impulses are apt to be right on the mark.

<br/><br/>

Women with this aspect (from the Astrology Profile for Women report): Your Moon
is in opposition aspect to Uranus, adding a high level of unpredictability to
your emotional nature and a need for personal independence. You need excitement,
change and distraction, but at levels you can tolerate without totally
disrupting your life. You may also be more comfortable when you're independent,
instead of being tied to a set schedule, a certain role or a particular list of
demands. As an independent woman, you are more likely to tolerate
commitments. If you're expected or demanded to do certain things, you may just
rebel for the sake of rebellion. After all, you're an individual! There may be
other planetary aspects in your chart which add a level of focus and stability
to your life, but this influence alone can disrupt even the best laid plans! At
the level of your soul you cry out to be seen and accepted for who you are,
unconditionally. That acceptance must first come from within yourself.

<br/><br/>

This influence also indicates the possibility of higher than normal fluctuations
in hormonal levels, which can also stimulate more profound emotional
changeability. Those who are close to you probably recognize a cyclical level to
your alterations in mood, and you can probably tie them to a cycle yourself if
you pay attention. You may or may not decide to choose motherhood as an option,
and may be more comfortable in non-traditional relationships. To maintain a
relationship you need plenty of room to be yourself. And to be the kind of
mother you want to be, you need to develop a supportive relationship with your
children which has some levels of consistency. You may relate to teen-agers more
easily than to small children.
