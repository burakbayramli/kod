Because the ego and the mind are aligned, people with Sun conjunct Mercury
possess much mental energy. They are always in a position to think about what
they want, and in many ways, this is an interruption of the will. Mercury brings
definition to whatever it contacts, and when aligned with the Sun, the natives
apply logic and definition to the will--and the will generally works better when
it is allowed to "just be" rather than be analyzed. The result is much
intelligence and communication ability, and a lot of pride invested in the
intellectual capacities. These people may not listen as well as they speak,
however! They might be too busy thinking about what to say next. As far as
studying or learning goes, they are better off reading the material than
listening to a teacher. These traits come from a strong need to take an active
role in communications. It is very hard for these people to passively listen and
absorb information.

Their opinions are usually strong and they are independent thinkers. They tend
to be proud of their opinions and their thoughts, and might easily get a bruised
ego if they are not "heard", if their opinions are pushed aside or ignored, or
if their opinions are criticized. Sun conjunct Mercury people are expressive
and, in some cases, very animated speakers.
