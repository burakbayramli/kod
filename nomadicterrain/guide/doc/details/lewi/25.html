<h3>25</h3>
<p>
Your sign makes you mentally "quick as a cat," witty, versatile, and
mobile, both in mind and body. You are naturally alert, active, and
aggressive. At your best, you have a very ambitious nature, asserting
yourself in a positive and confident manner in whatever direction you
decide to go. You are a fun companion and a dangerous opponent,
especially in a battle of words. You are intellectually motivated with
an inclination for study and education, a desire always to stay up to
date by study and the gathering of information on vital topics. Thus,
you generally have a vast fund of information, stories, and quips, and
when you're with friends, you're likely to be the life of the
party. You will get far in life simply because of your natural
popularity and your aptness in human relations. The problem can be
that you may rely too much on wit, cleverness, and quickness to
replace serious application. Nonetheless, people follow you
instinctively because you seem to know where you are going and how to
get there. Your sense of balance and direction is often based on a
whim of the moment rather than logic and forethought. But you are a
good leader because you are so sure of yourself, and because you make
people feel that you think they are great, too. You are especially
shrewd in business matters in a more or less a wheeler-dealer sort of
way. In this you can show a selfish side, as while you are such a
social person, you never forget to look out for number
one. Emotionally there is nothing very deep or profound about you. You
know what you like and what you don't like, and it's hard for anyone
to tie you down for very long. You need to be constantly in motion,
physically and mentally.
