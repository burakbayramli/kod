You are a perfectionist. You can pick at yourself and others unmercifully,
trying to get circumstances in your life to match some unspecified
standard. Your energy becomes freer to work in an unencumbered way when you
recognize that you aren't really looking to match an objective standard at
all. What you want is to find some emotionally and psychologically defendable
ground to stand on. The real trick in life for you is to keep moving. This is
not easy since you should really only move ahead on a project after forethought
or planning; your judgments tend to be colored by your fears or your momentary
desires. You work very hard for what comes to you. This is unavoidable. But, you
could end up working very hard for no gain. This is avoidable through balancing
your drives with your responsibilities. You find that you have better health and
much freer energy if you get vigorous physical exercise at least three times a
week.

Mars square Saturn or Mars opposition Saturn: *You work hard and patiently to
achieve your objectives, persevering and continuing on in spite of difficulties
and discouragement. Concentrating on a single, clearly defined goal, you are
able to accomplish much, but you often feel that the way is long and arduous,
and that you must struggle on alone, that it's all on your shoulders.

<br/><br/>

You are capable of great self-control and self-denial and can be a hard task
master, expecting far too much of yourself. You also tend to hold yourself back,
to doubt your own power and ability. You feel that you meet with great
resistance whenever you try to assert yourself or take initiative. Anger and
frustration can be big problems for you, especially when you try to work with
other people or depend too much on others for support. You work best in
solitude.

<br/><br/>

Your involvement with other people often focuses on the harshest side of human
experience. You become aware of destructive energies around you and learn to
overcome these difficulties. Your spiritual life can become the source of nearly
inexhaustible energy. You face tests through death or separation.
