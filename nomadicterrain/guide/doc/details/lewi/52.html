Your sign gives you a well integrated personality as both bodies are
placed in the signs with which they are naturally associated. The
positive force of the Sun placed in Leo serves to offset any tendency
toward moodiness and being too introspective, traits of the Cancer
Moon, keeping you up most of the times. The Leo tendency to boast and
grab the spotlight are well balanced and controlled by the modest
reserve of the Moon. You have a natural warmth and sympathetic
friendship, and people are attracted to you because you are such an
understanding listener. You're not exactly a social butterfly, but you
do enjoy good company and a good time. Friends never hesitate to
confide in you because you are so dependable and trustworthy, and when
there is some way you can be of help you always do. You know your
worth so well that you take it for granted and don't waste time trying
to impress others with it. You are realistic about life, always
applying common sense to situations and striving to do the best you
can do. Your feet are planted ever so solidly on the ground. Romance
and love are very important to you and you'll never be very happy
until you have found someone on whom you can lavish your
affections. Soundness is the keynote of your nature, and everything
you do seems to have a stamp of character, persistence, and the honest
desire to maintain good will.
