<h3>101</h3>
<p>
YOu have a warm-hearted, honest, and open personality. The pairing
blends the personal dash, optimism, enthusiasm and directness of
Sagittarius, with the warmth, generosity, pride, and authoritativeness
of Leo. You have a love of mankind and a code that combines good
judgment with a very tolerant attitude. This combination is very
dedicated; dedicated to honor, prestige, and achieving stature in the
world. And to attain you goals, you are not one to take shortcuts; not
one to lie, to cheat, or to do anything underhanded in order to gain
an advantage. Honor is all important and your word is an unbreakable
bond. The fiery combination of these two signs doesn't need any unfair
advantages to succeed because there is more than enough energy and
enthusiasm to get where you want to be. You'll keep pursuing your
goals long after others have thrown in the towel. When you go after
something, you go after it tooth and nail. Any obstacle you face is
considered only a temporary problem and little gets you down for
long. This is a very positive combination, quite indicative of
happiness and success. If you can avoid scattering your energies, you
can move mountains. You are naturally inclined toward public service,
either in law, education, or government. The prestige of the position
being more important than the salary. This is a high-minded
combination, full of ideas and ideals. You may have problems dealing
with the small people of the world that refuse to grow and
progress. You are intellectually philosophic, broad-minded, and highly
creative. Your creativity is in the ability to form an image in your
mind and then bring to reality that clear picture you envisioned. You
take life seriously, with a keen sense of the importance of making the
most of it. Unless something is really messed up in your chart, you
are truly a super person.
