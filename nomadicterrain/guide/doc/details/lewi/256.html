Moon square Pluto: Feelings of judgment and disagreement with others can leave
you feeling paranoid. Emotional limitations and self-judgments stop you from
being open with others. Realize that excessive secrecy stops you from getting
correct (or enough) information from your environment. Self-defeating habits
hold you back until you are able to get beyond unconscious fears. 

<br/><br/>

Moon opposition Pluto: Emotional standoffs block your growth. Rational
compromise stops addictive and self-defeating behavior. It takes tremendous self
insight to see that the things that bother you most about others are qualities
of your own being. Real change in your emotional nature is not only possible but
inevitable. Don't ever lose hope or indulge in thoughts of failure or
guilt. Real release of old emotional habits brings instant transformation. 

<br/><br/>

You have intense desires and feelings and your personal relationships
are deeply emotional, passionate, and often stormy and painful as
well. There are powerful magnetic ties between yourself and those you
care about, and you could become emotionally obsessed by another
person. Your feelings can become so urgent and compelling that you do
things that are not rational. You undergo periodic emotional upheavals
and purging, when you must break all ties, release the past and begin
anew.

<br/><br/>

This is a lifetime in which you have chosen to purge yourself of some
deep psychic pain and some emotional refuse that you may have carried
for quite a long time. Your most intimate relationships, especially
with females and with family members are apt to be highly-charged,
karmic affairs which churn up some very intense, primal
feelings. Experiences of separation, loss, betrayal and abandonment,
especially early in life, trigger memories of similar events in your
incarnational past. You may find yourself over-reacting to situations
in the present, and the vehemence of your feelings may seem excessive
and irrational. From time to time, you are likely to get swept up in a
tidal wave of emotion, the source of which may not be obvious to
you. You equate closeness and emotional intimacy with fearful
experiences from your past, but you are compelled to seek out
situations and people who will force you to re-experience much of your
unresolved grief, and thus to finally release it. Emotional power
struggles and subtle (and overt) attempts at emotional blackmail may
be major themes in at least one significant relationship in your life.

<br/><br/>

You may be the black sheep in your family, the one who brings to light some
hidden aspect of your family life, discovering and delving into the skeletons in
the closet. Periodic emotional crisis and catharsis are likely. You have an
opportunity to use these times to greatly accelerate your growth, deepen your
self knowledge, and heal old wounds. It can be very helpful to find supportive
friends during such times, for you tend to isolate yourself. Because of past
trauma, you tend to fear emotional dependency or allowing yourself to admit how
needy and vulnerable you are. At times you feel like an insatiable child who can
never get enough reassurance, comfort, or nurturance. These feelings are
difficult for you to admit. You may have very intense feelings about not having
your own children (who would bring up all of these issues for you), or an
equally deep, urgent desire to have them, in order to somehow give them the
support and care you need yourself. Past-life regression and healers of core
issues address the wounded "inner child" and would most likely benefit you a
great deal. Certain stones can also be worn or carried to help facilitate your
process, including: amethyst, malachite, moonstone and watermelon tourmaline.

<br/><br/>

Women with this aspect (from the Astrology Profile for Women report): With your
Moon in opposition to Pluto, you feel everything at a deep, intense level. You
rarely wade in the shallows, since immersing yourself in whatever you're doing
is much more gratifying. Your intensity can also stimulate compulsive or
obsessive levels of behavior. You can also be an intimidating woman, especially
when you're focused on something (or someone!), and can become completely
absorbed in your own feelings. This energy is wonderful for healing, since you
have the capability of penetrating into the depths and releasing blocks;
although it may be easier to direct this energy toward someone else than it is
to direct toward yourself.

<br/><br/>

Men who are uncomfortable with their emotional nature and their own
vulnerabilities may feel exposed when they are around you. Even though you may
not intend to overwhelm them, you sometimes do. In your close relationships, it
is crucial to allow others to be themselves, warts and all. Your tendency might
be to transform them, and that could be dangerous. However, if a person is
working towards change, you can certainly be helpful, and you may be the
catalyst for change in the lives of many people. As a mother, you can be
extremely attentive and aware. You can also be overly protective and can create
an atmosphere of claustrophobia for your kids if you go too far. Use your
sensibilities to determine how your children are responding, and allow yourself
to back off when necessary. Otherwise, you may reach a point where it feels that
you are abandoning ship in the midst of a storm.

<br/><br/>

Through the tense square between your Moon and Pluto in your chart, your
emotionality is extremely intensified. You may hold some deep-seated
resentments, and can hang onto guilt eternally unless you make an effort to
release it. Your trust of your own power as a woman can be undermined,
especially if you felt emotionally abused as a child. It is quite possible that
you were mistreated because one of your parents resented your being there, but
you may also have been simply struggling for survival in a situation which
provided little emotional nurturance. Regardless of the particulars of your
early conditioning, you do have the capability to healing these old wounds
through the same energy which has sustained their pain.

<br/><br/>

You may be drawn to relationships for the pure physical pleasure and stimulation
they provide, but may not want to feel emotionally close due to your lack of
trust. Yet deep within your soul you may long for that bonding which results
from the alchemy of two souls merging. Since you were not issued an instruction
manual about how to deal with people when you entered this life, you need to
give yourself plenty of time and room to research human nature and human
emotion. Safe circumstances like a friendship with someone who shares your
interests can give you a chance to learn about trust - but you must be honest
about your feelings! Even though you might think that you would prefer to live
apart from society, fitting into social situations can help you trust yourself
more fully, because interacting with others helps you develop objectivity. To
have the love and tenderness you need from others, you must learn forgiveness,
too. That forgiveness begins within yourself, and releasing tension and stress
while also letting go of the burdens from your past will help you feel much more
light, alive and free. Then, and only then, can you feel good about the power of
being a whole woman.
