You have a conservative streak in you that is seeking the lowest common
denominator. You get to your goal in life and accomplish much by slow, tenacious
effort. Your life really takes off between the ages of 27 and 36. It is during
this time that you "find yourself". Your success is directly linked to the
success of the culture. You rise and fall with the fortunes of everyone
else. Seeing this principle in operation, perhaps you can pace yourself so that
you don't waste time and energy trying to push your own life forward faster than
the country or the social order can assimilate it. 

<br/><br/>

Your aspirations and dreams are always tempered by realism and practical
considerations. You pursue your aims in a systematic, disciplined, and thorough
manner, and you are willing to take your time, advancing slowly and steadily on
your way to your goal.

<br/><br/>

Sometimes you underestimate what is possible, and hold yourself back
unnecessarily due to a lack of faith or an overly cautious attitude.

<br/><br/>

Patience is the key ingredient to management of change in your life. You have
survived many previous changes, and your spiritual future will doubtless include
some more. You make progress in seclusion.

<br/><br/>

This aspect occurs about every nineteen years, lasts for a considerable period,
and thus affects large numbers of people born during these times. In general, it
indicates a period of law and order, and people born under it are pillars of
society, quietly and nobly ambitious to succeed, but willing to do so only in an
orthodox and utterly honorable fashion. If you have this aspect you are
conventional, orderly, proud, aspiring, with a quiet dignity about you that
impresses your friends. In whatever sphere you may be you are supported and made
prosperous and secure to some extent.  If you also have Moon conjunct/sextile/or
trine Jupiter, or Sun conjunct/sextile or trine Jupiter: You will rise to
considerable honor, or even fame, though you will have a long apprenticeship to
serve before your value and worth are recognized. You are eager for recognition
but hate notoriety, so your recognition when it comes will rest on secure
foundations.  If you also have Mars square or opposition Saturn: You have a
swifter rise, more aggressive nature, and less certain tenure of public
approval.  If you also have Mars sextile or trine Saturn, or Jupiter sextile or
trine Uranus, or Jupiter sextile or trine Neptune: There is a probability of
wealth.  This position is somewhat late in bringing its benefits, generally not
being felt until after the thirtieth year, except in setting the mold of your
personality and your ambitions; but after this it works steadily on your
side. Positions of influence are most likely - government, army, ministry, the
law. You may be an author, leaving your imprint on literature for generations.
