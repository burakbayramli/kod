Because this aspect aligns two "yin" energies, it's not one of those aspects
that defines a person, but the characteristics are there, even if they're in
hiding! Every conjunction is modified by any planets that aspect it, and with
Moon-Venus, perhaps even more so, as both the Moon and Venus are receptive
energies and easily modified. And, this concept extends to character
traits. There is a part of the nature that is very sensitive, and although
they're not necessarily "easily modified", their sensitivity to others and to
their environment suggests a part of the personality that automatically
acquiesces.  Whether this is an obvious trait or one that is carefully hidden,
it's there, and it often has roots in the experience of the mother. For whatever
reason, this experience gave the message to the child that one has to submit to
others in order to find happiness, although in absolute terms, of course, it is
not true. Different expressions of this aspect can include people who constantly
feel the need to adapt to others, those who use roundabout ways to charm others
into getting what they want, or people who do everything they can to avoid
conflict. The mother or mother figure may have herself displayed these
tendencies--using charm rather than directness to get what she wanted, or she
may have been submissive and adaptable, always tiptoeing around others so as to
avoid conflict. Or she may have been susceptible to charm--the child may have
discovered early in life that to get what he or she wanted (attention,
generally) from the mother, the most effective vehicle was charm, pretense, and
other indirect tactics.

These people are highly sensitive to criticism and rejection. They usually spend
a lot of time and energy finding ways to avoid both. Men with this aspect can be
especially appealing to women, as they seem to be quite sympathetic to women, or
at the very least they possess a romantic and gentle side that makes women feel
very comfortable. Both sexes attract women to them easily, in fact.

Some of these people have an air of accessibility surrounding them--an
unmistakable charm. The nature of that charm is found in the characteristics of
the sign the Moon and Venus occupy. If in signs like Aries or Scorpio, the charm
is less accessible in nature, but it's still present in spades. Appearances are
often important to these individuals, and/or there is a distinct need for
peaceful, beautiful, and balanced home environments. There is often a strong
connection to animals, and most people with this aspect truly hate to see others
in pain. They are empathic people, possessing much sensitivity
themselves. However, they generally don't like getting their "hands dirty", and
would prefer that others deal with difficult emotional, or other such "messy",
situations.

The Moon represents our innermost needs, and with Venus attached to it, Venus is
one of the vehicles by which Moon-Venus people attempt to satisfy their
emotional needs, and the Moon is one of the vehicles by which they try to
satisfy their needs for companionship. The desire for companionship, therefore,
becomes a need. A soft, gentle, and charming approach is generally employed in
order to attempt to satisfy emotional needs. There can be a great love of
comfort food and a sensuality that is sometimes felt to be insatiable. These
people shop--or eat--when they're unhappy! It's especially important to avoid
the tendency to mistake pleasure for love, or to use pleasure as a substitute
for love.
