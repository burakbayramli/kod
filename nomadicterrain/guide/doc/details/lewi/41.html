<p>
Your sign produces a Cancer that is a good deal less shy and demure
than is normally expected. In personality, you are positive and
confident, emphasizing pride, dignity and self-respect. You appear
open-hearted, amiable and outgoing. You always strive to make a good
first impression because you are a proud person, and you care a good
deal about what people think of you. You expect and enjoy having a
broad base of support and respect from those whom you come in
contact. Your security is knowing others like you and you seem to
crave attention and respect. You attract this with your warm, sunny
personality, but somehow you manage to keep most people at a distance
and never get really close with very many individuals. You distrust
people, but you tolerate their shortcomings and feel that you can
control most individuals and circumstances. You meet unexpected
situations and do the right thing at the right time. Your style is
always neat and organized and you don't like to be around sloppy
people or disorganized situations. You take yourself seriously,
perhaps even to the degree of being a little pompous and
self-righteous at times. You know how to get your way while making
others feel that they are the winners, and that you are the one who is
compromising. Under a rather gentle exterior is a core of independence
and determination that others rarely see or realize.
