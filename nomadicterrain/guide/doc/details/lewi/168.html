It's difficult to be indifferent towards people with Sun conjunct Mars in their
natal charts. They have presence. There is a courageous air about them, and they
exude confidence even if they don't own it! If they're not highly active and
energetic people, they are most certainly confrontational. They get right to the
point, go right for the jugular, and they make things happen. You might call
them impatient, but not in a nervous sense of the word--they simply can't wait
around for something to happen. They want something, and they want it now.

<br/><br/>

These people have a competitive spirit. They like to win. Channeled into sports
and games, they make formidable opponents, although sports that require strategy
may not be their forte, simply because they are apt to apply force to get to
their goals. If not channeled this way, they make formidable business
opponents. Those without a "channel", however, run the risk of being
bullies--looking for a fight, getting all fired up and hot under the collar, and
stirring up trouble at every turn. Properly channeled, however, these people are
gutsy, not afraid of conflict, and really quite daring. If you peel away the
layers, however, you might find a rather insecure person who does everything in
their power to prove themselves.

<br/><br/>

Because we are combining two masculine planets, people with this aspect might be
considered masculine in expression, regardless of their gender. In love, they
like to be the ones who do the pursuing. They love the thrill of the chase, but
they might tire easily once they have "conquered". If you don't really like
them, no problem. They take that as a dare.
