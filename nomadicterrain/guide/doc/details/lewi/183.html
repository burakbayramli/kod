You get along with most people and are usually willing to make compromises in
relationships to maintain harmony. That doesn't mean you become a doormat for
others, but you have a strong sense of fairness and do not offend others without
just cause. Others are seldom threatened or intimidated by you, largely because
of your affable nature and social grace. You are willing to listen to anyone's
opinions and suggestions before making major decisions.

<br/><br/>

Direct competition may be uncomfortable for you, and you may feel more at ease
working with a small group of people. Perhaps you enjoy public speaking or
performing in the dramatic arts. Another possible source of satisfaction for you
would be writing, because of your natural talent for expressing yourself
well. You have an imaginative mind and are clever at cooking up schemes to
improve your economic situation. It is not difficult for you to turn your many
creative ideas into ready cash.

<br/><br/>

Others will usually support you in what you do because they can see that you
exercise good judgment. They can believe in you and are glad to pitch in to help
you succeed. Just be sure you don't ask anyone else to take risks you yourself
wouldn't attempt. Actually, any chances that you take will be well considered
and are probably not that risky after all.

<br/><br/>

In love relationships, you have a talent for communicating your needs and
desires to your partner. You are attracted to people who share your artistic
talents or at least an appreciation of the arts. The worst possible mate for you
would be one who is socially uncouth. In sex you have a healthy open attitude
and can discuss the subject rather easily with your partner. Verbal expression
during sex can be very stimulating for you! A lover who doesn't communicate or
who is quiet in bed may not be very satisfying for you in the long haul.

<br/><br/>

You appreciate aesthetics and have a fine sense of form, design, and
beauty. You could develop considerable technical skill as an artist,
designer, craftsman, or creative writer. You could also sell objects
of beauty - artistic products, cosmetics, jewelry, etc. You have the
ability to please and harmonize well with others and tend to
ameliorate relationships between people. Your sense of humor, tact,
and personal charm are of great benefit to you in any work with people
on a one-to-one level.

<br/><br/>

You have a love affair going with the mind and you value all of its offspring:
words, ideas, thoughts, and such. And you love to talk. In particular you
appreciate good conversation, and you feel that stimulating mental adventures
(either alone or with others) are among the most exciting experiences life
offers. You have a built-in sense of discrimination when it comes to the
intellect - all mental activities.
