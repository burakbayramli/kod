the warmth, nobility, and balance of Leo. People respond to you
naturally because of you are an interesting, active, adventurous, and
exciting person. You pursue your ideals with great energy, excitement,
a sense of adventure, and boundless enthusiasm. You love people and
they respond to you in a very positive way to your magnetic
personality. Self-image is all important to you, and you have a
natural faith in yourself and probably a total confidence in your
abilities. You respect yourself to a high degree and see yourself as a
natural born leader. You need to achieve to reinforce this wonderful
sense of worth, and to maintain a rightful position of leadership and
popularity. Success may come because you can come up with good ideas,
but more often it is because those above you and those below you both
like you a lot and are willing to listen and follow you. You don't
hesitate to tell people that you "need" them, because in your open and
honest way, you're confident that they will respond to you and back
your cause. You have a warm heart and an affectionate nature, because
of a harmonious blending of individuality and personality; thinking
and feeling are very much in tune. You have a talent for clear vision
or for visualizing your goal or objective, concentrating on these
goals and objectives, and attaining them.
