<h3>104</h3>
<p>
Your sign has much self-reliance, and a life that develops very
rapidly in the early years. You know what you want and you know how to
achieve your ends; a true go-getter. Blended are the well-developed
capacity for judgment and wisdom innate in Sagittarius, and the
Scorpio's knack for throwing everything into a project and fighting
until the battle is won. Thus, it is easy to see why you can
accomplish so much when you set your mind to it. Optimism and
determination; a truly hard combination to defeat. Your nature is
subtle and clever, as well, making you good at strategy in handling
affairs in business or in the professions. The challenge of this
position is handling people with tact and diplomacy, controlling
temperament, and avoiding too direct or too blunt of an approach. You
have to avoid conflict to really succeed. Your mind is quick and the
ability to think on your feet is really superb, but all of this
quickness is wasted if you are too impetuous. You have a lot of
emotional energy, which when under the control and direction of your
will and your mind, gives the force to achieve very high objectives in
life. Actually, there is a good bit of sensitivity in your nature, and
much of your aggressiveness is a defense that instinctively
attacks. Your attacks are aimed right at the most vulnerable spot in
what you say or do. You need to concentrate on listening to the
opinions of others, and control your emotional reactions, allowing
them to work for you.
