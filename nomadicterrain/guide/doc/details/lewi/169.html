Unless Saturn is also involved with this aspect, individuals with Sun conjunct
Jupiter in their natal charts are enthusiastic and optimistic. They truly expect
the best from themselves, from others, and from life. They prefer to see the
good in the world.

<br/><br/>

Their confidence in everything turning out all right can also get them into some
trouble. Over-indulgence in food or drink, gambling, shopping whatever their
pleasure is a high possibility, simply because these people can be
procrastinators and put too much faith in life "fixing" things on its own. They
might eat just for the sake of eating, indulge in expensive items temporarily
forgetting the reality of the bill arriving the following month, and so
forth. It can be hard for them to save money.

<br/><br/>

The truth is, many times it seems like these people have a guardian angel who
sweeps in and saves their behinds, sometimes at the very last minute. They tend
to "get away with" more than most people. But inevitably they'll face some
consequences for their excesses, such as an expanding waistline or growing debt.

<br/><br/>

Although not especially competitive, Sun conjunct Jupiter individuals have a
cheerful outlook and tend to accomplish quite a bit. They are quite
resourceful. They generally are able to win over others, as theirs is a nature
that is willing to help out others rather than argue with them. They come across
as fair, big-hearted, and sincere. Generous with their time and money, these
people are easy to like. Because they tend to over-estimate their capabilities,
they can promise more than they can deliver.

<br/><br/>

Some people with this aspect can be self-righteous and moralistic. Others
express the teaching side of Jupiter. Still others are prone to exaggeration,
although their stories are so interesting that people tend to overlook it.

<br/><br/>

Although largely positive and optimistic, Sun-Jupiter people are not immune to
depression. Although short-lived, their downs can be dramatic, simply because
they are unprepared for these times.
