<p>
You are a vigorous thinker who is capable of rising to a high position
through the strength and originality of mind and expression. We
probably don't have to worry too much about your self-esteem; it is
naturally strong and a key feature of your success. This is a very
practical and executive combination. It blends the personal dash,
optimism, enthusiasm, foresight, and directness of manner common with
Sagittarius, and the ambition, shrewdness, realism and practicability
of Capricorn. This is great for dealing in business affairs. Mental
prudence or instinctive cautiousness enable you to keep expansive
plans or ideas on a practical or realistic basis. Good foresight lets
you chart the way things turn out and intuitively understand the
future course of business. Viewed as practical, realistic and
ambitious, you garner a good deal of responsibility. Personal
integrity is a strong point in your nature and this help you build a
flawless reputation. While the Capricorn Moon will never let you lose
sight of your goals, the Sagittarius Sun want more than just power and
is ever seeking happiness and personal satisfaction in the job well
done. While its almost certain business will be the center of your
attention, other interests will be important, as well. Cultural
associations such as music and art can have decided appeal. You are
highly executive, and definitely an executive with outstanding
balance.
