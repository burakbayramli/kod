<p>
Argumentative and rather aggressive and critical in discussions, you
tend to turn any conversation into a debate, and sometimes a verbal
war. You could be a spokesman for a righteous cause, a lawyer
vigorously defending a client, a sharp analyst or critic. You are a
convincing speaker, but are not especially receptive to the ideas and
opinions of others. You have a forceful intellect and an aptitude for
mental work.
