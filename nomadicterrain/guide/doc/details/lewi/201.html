Whether these natives are shy or outgoing, law-abiding or reckless, quiet or
loud...they possess a very grand idea of love, and they have an indulgent side
to them that is unmistakable, and possibly hard to control. Jupiter expands
whatever it touches, and in this case, it's enlarging the qualities of Venus:
romance, relationship, pleasure, and money. This doesn't necessarily mean that
all of these things will come easily to natives with a Venus-Jupiter
conjunction. But the appetite for pleasure, romance, and, in some cases,
material things, is big. Their hearts are big too--most of the time, if given a
choice, they'll opt for the high road. They are generous with people they love
(and with themselves!), dangerous with a credit card, and incurable
romantics. They tend to assign positive traits to the people they love, whether
those people deserve them or not!

<br/><br/>

One of their weak spots is their love of pleasure. Some have a definite lazy
streak. They are very affectionate people who are generous with their emotions
and, usually, their pocketbook too. When they care about you, they are quite
loyal and faithful. Their opinions about love and friendship are strong--they
generally have lofty ideals in these areas. Their hearts are open and they have
a tendency to want to give a lot to the people they love. They may live beyond
their means, especially if the conjunction is challenged by other planets. They
need to learn not to borrow from their future.

<br/><br/>

They have a greater than average need to grow in their love relationships, and
to shower their partners with acceptance and warmth. They have a strong need for
growth, good humor, and fun in their relationships. They have a marked disdain
for insincerity, placing great value on people with good intentions and good
hearts. They do whatever they can to make those around them feel comfortable,
accepted, and of value exactly as they are.

<br/><br/>

You are bighearted and openhanded with both your money and your
affections and you are not happy if you have to budget or restrict
yourself in any way. Pettiness or stinginess is foreign to your nature
and you feel most comfortable in an elegant, beautiful
atmosphere. Asceticism is not for you. Gracious and charitable, you
enjoy sponsoring social events or cultural activities. You have an
optimistic, friendly attitude towards others and tend to bring out the
finer side of people. You fall in love with someone who is successful,
noble, and idealistic.

<br/><br/>

The pursuit of wisdom parallels the pursuit of love in your life. Any conflict
in love relationships causes you to consider your spiritual values all over
again. You may like the stage of falling in love with a spiritual idea so much
that you choose to do it many times before you establish a solid foundation.
