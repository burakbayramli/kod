<p>
You have a somewhat reserved personality, but one that is well
concealed by the pleasant and outstanding image that is shown to the
world. You bluff the appearance of being sure of yourself and your
purposes. Actually, you have a great deal of difficulty making
decisions and your self-assurance is very thin indeed. You progress
best in activities in which the rules of the game are well established
and decisions play a minimal part in the evaluation of success. You
are well-endowed mentally, possessing a logical, systematic,
analytical and discriminating mind. Your strong point is in analysis
or analytical criticism, as you seek to build up a strictly rational
foundation of thought. You control feelings and emotions with an iron
grip. In all emotional matters you're careful and controlled. Much of
the time you are content to be pretty much a loner. You are not an
easy person to talk to or to live with because you are so aloof,
reserved, and cautious. Academically you may be outstanding,
especially when it comes to facts and realities. Perhaps not so when
it comes to theories and hypotheses. A precocious knack for grasping
facts may aim the focus of your life toward scholarly pursuits, and
your real strength come out when you are allowed to focus your
capacity for concentration on a single objective.
