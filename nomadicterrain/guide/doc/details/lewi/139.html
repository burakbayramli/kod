You have a congenial and dreamy personality that is very pleasant
indeed. This combination blends the emotional sensitivity and
intuitive understanding of Pisces, with the mental equilibrium,
courtesy and friendliness of Libra. This yields a nature that
possesses an equable temperament, seeking balance and a sense of
fitness and proportion in all you do. There is nothing base, crude,
earthy, ugly or terribly heavy about this personality. People respond
naturally to you because you more or less exude a pleasing aura, and
because you freely offer a ready ear and a bright, optimistic
outlook. Even if you are not an intellectual scholar, you seem to have
a very reliable sixth sense and extremely accurate
perceptions. Tolerance is your ideal, and you understand much that
others can't readily accept. You are not known for taking action, but
rather for planning and preparing. You dislike being on a tight
schedule or working under pressure. You don't put up with things that
get you "up tight,"and indeed, you may lack the staying power
sometimes to pull the really tough assignment through to
completion. Nonetheless, you have a very optimistic attitude and you
can see the "silver lining" in the clouds while others are still
watching the storm. Yours is such an equable temperament, with a keen
sense for harmony in sound, color and form. This is a combination that
seems to naturally seek balance and harmony, with aesthetic qualities
strongly marked.
