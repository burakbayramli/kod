<h3>3</h3>
<p>
You are one of the most verbally active pairs in the Zodiac. You're
likely to dominate any conversation as your mind works fast and
releases the information it has processed just as fast. You have to
learn to keep things to yourself at least until you've made up your
mind, which you don't find easy to do. It is easier for you to make
decisions by sitting down and talking things out rather than by
closing yourself off, studying the issues and concentrating on the
alternatives. Speaking before you think and jumping to conclusions can
get you in deep trouble. Success will come easier for you after you
have learned, and practice, the art of secrecy, clearly thinking
things through before you charge off. This shortcoming
notwithstanding, you are likely to get far in the world because of
your quick wit and good intentions. Your debate skills allow you to
back lesser opponents into the corner with relative
ease. Surprisingly, as quick as you act, you have an especially good
knack for details. In business, your command of facts and figures
gives you the semblance of the perfect executive. Nonetheless, you're
often guilty of a little oscillation and indecision stemming from too
many superficial facts and too little depth of study. Anyhow, fluency
of mind is your primary attribute. Your style of getting bits and
pieces of information and using them in a glib and effective way can
take far. You may aspire to become an executive. However, the hard
decision making necessary here may not be as natural for you as a spot
in advertising, the literary world, or in other areas where your
outstanding business acumen focused on anything dealing with the
spoken or written word can be employed. You should try to overcome a
certain superficiality with respect to both intellectual and emotional
matters.
