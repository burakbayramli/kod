Because these people value harmony, they may find themselves giving in to others
too easily, especially in the first half of life. Resentment is possible, as
they feel that they are the ones who seem to do all the acquiescing. There can
be a distinct tendency to become friends (and lovers) with people too readily,
simply because there is a strong need for approval and a hunger for receiving
affection. As such, these people may get involved with people who seem to really
like them, and they don't consider whether they actually like them back! It's
somewhat of a weakness, as these people are very charmed by the idea that
someone seems to really like them and appreciate them. Generally, one of life's
lessons for these people is to learn to discriminate more and to get in touch
with what they truly want and need.

The functions of the Moon (which rules the emotions and feelings, amongst other
things) and the functions of Venus (which rules social relationships, harmony,
and partnership, amongst other things) are at cross-purposes. When these people
attempt to feed the needs of one function, it is often at the expense of the
other, until they find some sort of balance. This can play out in a variety of
ways. For example, there can be conflicts in partnerships about parenting or
whether or not to have a family. They can find themselves compromising their own
emotional needs in order to find and keep love. Peace and harmony are important
to these people--perhaps too much so, as they can easily be taken advantage
of. Insecurity is something that these people need to deal with at some point in
their lives.

Very sensual, people with Moon in hard aspect to Venus sometimes replace love
with food or shopping! They are also usually quite sexually active and sometimes
quite lustful. They are usually skilled in the arts. There is a distinct lazy
streak. Most are able to work hard, but they truly appreciate luxuriating and
enjoying as many pleasures as possible, and self-discipline simply isn't always
at their disposal!
