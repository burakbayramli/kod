The ego is quite large when the Sun is square or opposite Uranus. This
is largely due to the fact that these people's very identities ride on
their sense of personal freedom. It can be quite a challenge to get
them to do what they don't want to do, simply because they see any
attempts to push them in a certain direction as threatening their
freedom. These are very dynamic individuals who question tradition and
authority, yet, paradoxically, are quite set in their own ways.

<br/><br/>

These people have a love-hate relationship with their own uniqueness. Much of
the time they are very proud of their original personalities. Other times, they
feel a bit left out for being "different". Although they are humanitarian in
many ways, they can be a little brusque when it comes to sentimentality or what
they perceive to be excessive attachment to the past or to tradition.

When the Sun and Uranus form a challenging aspect, there can be a lot of nervous
energy and defensiveness. It can be difficult to hold a 9 to 5 job or to develop
steady routines. They work best when they can manage their own schedules. They
work in spurts. When they are hit with creative inspiration, they are capable of
tremendous effort. However, they can be quite temperamental, and it is very hard
for them to pour their hearts and souls into something that they don't "feel"
for at the moment. They don't like superficiality or pretense, which is an
admirable trait. However, their disdain for pretense can be problematic in a
world where people are expected to perform whether they are inspired or not! I
have a daughter who has the Sun in challenging aspect to Uranus, and there was
quite an adjustment period when she entered first grade--a time when kids begin
to truly experience structure. When the children in her gym class were told to
dance, she simply stood there, immobile. When asked why she was not dancing, she
replied, "But I don't feel the dance inside of me, so how can I dance?"
Sun-Uranus people don't always feel like they "fit in" with the rules and
structures of society. However, those that recognize the need to conform at
least some of the time may be able to channel their high levels of intuition,
inventiveness, and spiritedness into creative endeavors or important
causes. They might find that they encounter much less resistance in day-to-day
life this way.
