<h3>71</h3>
<p>
You are one who, in part, is very earth bound and practical, while
another part is somewhere above the horizon searching for truth,
understanding, and knowledge. You strive to be aloof from the mundane
elements of everyday life, as this is not a combination featuring much
human emotion and passion. Periodic moods of emotionalism and
romanticism notwithstanding, you're inclined to be cool and
self-sufficient at heart. You can be insensitive in the way you handle
people. You tell them what you think rather than what they want to
hear, expecting them to be big enough to handle it; supreme
objectivity, it might be called. You are a sympathetic person, but
it's more because of your totally objective way of looking at things,
rather than just a bleeding heart. You can use sympathy and
understanding without letting your judgment get too clouded with
emotion. In romance, the intellectual connection and perhaps romantic
idealism, is more important to you than the emotional and physical
side of love. You can become absorbed and occupied with an idea or a
plan, a true mental explorer, dreaming, scheming and trying to satisfy
an endless curiosity. You are a somewhat suspicious person, critical
and judicial. Your mind may often be unconventional, but you are
usually guided by a sound analytical and intuitive sense.
