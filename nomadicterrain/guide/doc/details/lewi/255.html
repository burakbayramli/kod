<h3>255</h3>
<p>
The keyword for your emotional life is quality not quantity. You tend to have
few very close friends instead of having many people around you to whom you are
connected very little. You are a just person while measuring people up, you tend
to weight deeper attributes about someone's character instead of shallower
ones. Your warmth amplifies your emotional reactions through attachement and
loyalty, you have a tender protectiveness you extend to others without being too
overbearing about it.
