You have a very active and fertile imagination and your ambitions are
never strictly mundane, practical, and concrete. You have a strong
desire to act out your fantasies, dreams, visions, and
ideals. Artistic creation, drama, or other areas in which you can
express yourself imaginatively are excellent for you. Ordinary life
seems drab and uninteresting to you, and you need to have some big
dream or something larger than your own narrow personal interests to
live for. Sometimes you may be confused about exactly how and where to
direct your energy and often drift along rather than making clear
decisions about what you want. You have a passive side and at times
lack the will power, physical energy, strength, and the fighting
spirit to achieve your aims.

At some point in your life you may feel that the gods or goddesses step in to
impose changes on you. What you make of these moments determines your spiritual
future. Generally, whatever effort you make will be well worth your time.
