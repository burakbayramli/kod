Your sign produces the quick mind and broad scope of intelligence that
may enable you to achieve public notoriety. Your mind can grasp
details without missing the big picture. You seem to have the gift of
foresight and insight, seeing both the fact and the
potentialities. Your uncanny foresight or intuition allows you to be
one of those people with the ability always to be looking ahead and
anticipating the need for change and improvement. You are a true
progressive. You can organize and express what you know in a clear and
concise fashion. You are genuinely humanitarian, generous, and possess
a desire to help others, so you can make an excellent teacher in
whatever walk of life you choose. You seem to have a romantic outlook
on life that can find, rather than create, beauty in your
surroundings. Philosophical to an extreme, you are very understanding,
tolerating, and accepting of others in a broad sense. So your circle
of friends is probably extremely large and loyal. You are depressed by
any sense of restriction or restraint the keeps you from doing your
thing. Routine activities or affairs that confine you too much are
impossible to tolerate. Your mind is agile and flexible, you seem able
skillfully to handle either side of an argument with equal ease, and
you often do. Enigmatic and interesting, you are always an
entertaining person to be around.
