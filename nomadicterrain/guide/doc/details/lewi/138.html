Your personality blends emotional sensitivity and intuitive
understanding with the Virgo traits of discrimination, intellectuality
and practicability. You are at your best in mental analysis,
constructive criticism and common sense decisions. Your discriminating
mind tends to exert a stabilizing influence on emotional
sensitivity. There is a working together of the intuitive and
practical. You can make your intuitions, feelings and impressions
about things useful in practical affairs. You have a deep sense of the
truth and an ability to face facts. This is a combination that depends
heavily on discrimination and analytical insights into affairs; you
are naturally versatile, flexible and highly adaptable, but you have
the innate ability to keep your mind on whatever you are doing. While
you may have serious intent and considerable ambition, you don't seem
to take yourself too seriously. You do best in professions that don't
demand much in the way of exercising authority. Efficiency and
precision are the keynotes of your nature and of your mind. You have
little difficulty guiding your activity to avoid mistakes and
unnecessary errors. Particular and somewhat fastidious, you show good
taste in dress as well as in your choice of words. Happiness depends
on maintaining balance between the emotional and mental sides of your
nature, avoiding the tendency to alternate between sympathy and
coolness of response. You do good things quietly and with little fuss,
stressing conscientiousness and a subdued conviction. You live sanely
and calmly, achieving success through the exercise of intelligence.
