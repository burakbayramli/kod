You have a personality that is highly sociable, and one that clearly
possesses a good bit of social tact. You're a sensitive person, but
you likewise have an acute sense of the other person's feelings and
sensitivities, and you therefore are a very agreeable person that
avoids hurting anyone--that is until you're opposed--and then you can
get very stubborn. In other words, you are easy to get along with; you
don't impose on people, but you definitely won't allow yourself to be
imposed on either. You feel that debts have to be kept even, and even
in a social sense, you don't like to feel that you owe anyone. This
may be because you are a little bit unsure of yourself, and want to
make sure you say and do the right thing. This combination blends the
Pisces understanding, sensitivity, and a sense of adaptability, with
the practicality and determination of Taurus. The two signs blend
well, and are mutually strengthening to one another. This pairing
allows coexistence of an easy-going nature, yet one possessing a
stability and tenacity of will not often found in the Pisces
native. You have a staying power and a control over impulsiveness that
allows you to take things in stride, and you seem to have a simple and
efficient way of getting things done. Nonetheless, there is apt to be
considerable sensitivity in your nature, and surely a great deal of
feeling for things and people. This is a combination that very often
produces talent in an artistic or musical sense. Both signs are
creatively imaginative and suited for a career in the arts. The social
attitude of this pairing provides a deep consideration of others that
is very beneficial to success in a wide range of endeavors, business
and professional.
