Harmonious Mars/Jupiter aspects are a marker of worldly comfort and financial
success. The conjunction indicates a person who is energetic, resourceful,
frank, outspoken, pioneering, and adventurous. There is often executive ability
and an entrepreneurial attitude toward business ventures. You stand up for your
beliefs and would be a formidable opponent in any kind of battle or
competition. The energy of Mars combines with the expansiveness of Jupiter to
increase your enthusiasm, liveliness, and optimism. You probably enjoy travel,
flying, the outdoors, competitive sports, vigorous exercise, and other
Jupiter-ruled pursuits. Often there is an interest in philosophical, legal,
religious, scientific, or political matters.

You enjoy learning about something and then spreading the word to others. This
can lead to success in broadcasting, teaching, the travel industry, promoting,
propaganda, publicity, advertising, or Internet related businesses. You like to
display your talent before others. There may also be talent for Mars-ruled
occupations that require courage, energy and risk-taking (e.g., police,
military, etc.), or that involve the use of fire, explosives, weapons, or
instruments that penetrate the body (e.g., surgery, acupuncture, etc.). If this
conjunction forms stressful aspects, there may be problems with impulsive or
addictive behavior.  -- Interpretation from our Career report.

<br/><br/>

You have a positive, "can-do" attitude and tackle life's challenges
with relish. You are self-confident and have a strong will to succeed,
to see how much you can do and how far you can go. No matter what you
accomplish, you do not rest on your laurels. You want to keep on
going, to do even bigger things. You are forward-looking,
enterprising, and enthusiastic about new projects. You are not happy
in situations that do not offer you challenges and the potential for
growth and expansion in the future - no matter how secure or
satisfactory they may be in other respects. You enjoy competition, but
you compete mostly with yourself, to see how much of your vision and
potential you can really achieve. You make a good leader, inspiring
courage and confidence in others. You usually enjoy good health and
high vitality.

<br/><br/>

You find that most beginnings and endings in your life are fortunate, and you
are able to extract the spiritual lessons successfully. Occasionally you rebel
and run away from a lesson that could have been very informative.
