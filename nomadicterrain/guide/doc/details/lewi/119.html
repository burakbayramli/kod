<h3>119</h3>
<p>
You have a thoughtful, sincere, and responsible inner nature, and a
friendly personality. A good healthy respect for yourself and your own
talents demands the respect of others. Your sincerity and genuine
interest in people makes you very popular, and you enjoy involvement
in a good bit of public activity. The Aquarius Moon gives you a streak
of originality and sometimes genius that sets you apart from most
Capricorn; you're more progressive and apt to be attracted to new
interests and sudden mode changes effecting the way you feel about
things. While you believe strongly in traditional values and tested
methods, you are not afraid of the future and you rarely fail to sense
the merit of a good progressive idea. You have good insight into human
nature as well, and you're usually able to choose the right friends
and associates. You are at your best when involved in important groups
and associations, clubs or societies, for you know how to put your
personality over, and draw people to you. In this arena, your greatest
skill becomes apparent and you are opportunistic in selecting the
right people to deal with and to help you. In business, you have
splendid organizing abilities and skill for making money, often along
unusual lines, and especially when it requires using your special
talent for dealing with people. You have an independent streak in your
nature, however, and you work best without personal supervision. You
are not one to make snap judgments. You need time to think and
reflect. Given this time, you can always make sound progress through
prudent forethought and an ability to bridge the past to the present
and the future. Although always friendly, you have a hard
determination about you that is going to make itself felt. Your pride
is great and you may be something of a social climber; status is very
important to you. Your emotions are very controlled and guided by your
intelligence and judgment. Your calm and intelligence makes you a good
companion, but probably not a passionate lover. What you lack in ardor
you make up in stability.
