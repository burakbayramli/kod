There is likely to be a conflict between a need to be externally successful, and
an inner struggle to release tensions and transcend limitations. PArt of the
difficulty will lie in the irregular flow of your energies, which makes it hard
to generate momentum and persistence. You will feel that you should be a
success, and resent any need to progress slowly in your intended
direction. Suitable preparation is not an approach that really appeals to you,
yet it can be this failure to lay good foundations that can destroy future
success.

<br/><br/>

You need more clarity in your life. There is a spreading uncertainty within you
that makes it difficult to concentrate your energies and purpose together. You
are unsure of your real motivations, desires and needs; and there is no cohesive
belief structure that you can use as a temporary centre. What you do feel is
this frustrating tension, which inhibits your choices and options. Often you
make a few steps towards manifesting an intention, makea few preliminary plans,
then retreat from this, perhaps from a fear of failure or because a new idea has
suddenly attracted all your attention. You have a problem in being
self-disciplined and actually completing your intentions. Yet sometimes you can
be very impulsive, launching into things with little thought, and suddenly
waking up to discover that you have created a new problem or are in a situation
from which you have to withdraw. Much energy is wasted through such thrashing
about with no real idea of what you really want to do.

<br/><br/>

The energy to succeed is there, but it is locked away or dissipated through lack
of direction. The frustration will remain until you release the tension through
channelled intent, completing one project at a time. More self-evaluation as to
your dreams and desires will help, as through clarifying those you will be able
to determing the required direction that is necessary for achievement. Those
tendencies towards being too idealistic and impractical may need to be
moderated; and it may be that you will have to work closely with others in a
co-operative manner, so that mutual disicpline and focus helps to keep you in
line through a sense of group obligation and responsibility. The key is that you
need to change your way of operating in order to succeed.

<br/><br/>

You need to stay away from bets that look very promising but are very unlikely
to succeed.
