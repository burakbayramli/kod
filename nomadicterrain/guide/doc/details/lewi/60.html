Your sign brings together influences of very different natures. The
confident majesty of Leo and the more regressive, fluctuating and
variable traits of Pisces blend to produce what is usually a very
kind-hearted and likable personality. You are genuine in your attempt
to make those you are close to happy and secure. Tuned in and very
aware, you have the time and sympathy to listen and try to help those
around you. Emotional and sentimental, your advise and counsel comes
straight from the heart. It's really hard for you to remain cool and
aloof. It's also hard for you to say no to almost any sincere request,
a fact that can sometimes drain you physically and emotionally. Your
makeup includes a good deal of intuition, and you know well your
abilities, and try to live up to your high personal ideals. You are a
very honest person and find it very hard ever to fool
others. Fortunately, it may be equally hard for others to fool you,
for yours is an exception understanding of human nature and
motives. Outwardly, you can seem aggressive and forward, a bubbling
and vigorous exterior, while inwardly, you are so sensitive and
sentimental, perhaps brooding and philosophic. Subject to deep
thoughts, and sometimes fits of depression, you need many true friends
and companions to keep your spirits up. You are likely to be a very
serious person with motives that are usually the highest.
