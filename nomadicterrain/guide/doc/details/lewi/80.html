<h3>80</h3>
<p>
Your sign denotes a nature that is independent of mind and action,
thought and expression. You are both mentally quick and penetrating,
with an absorbing curiosity. Thus, you are a ready student,
precocious, and wanting to make rapid strides in the world. Your
superb logic and analytical abilities are wrapped in a wave of
emotionalism. You have a detective approach to things. Sneaking up on
a question, figuring out what it is you want to achieve, and pouncing
on it with full force. This is not a vague and undecided Libra. There
is spice in your nature, excess and extremes in your actions. You have
a strong sense of justice, and you can fly off the handle when you
feel you have been treated unfairly. On the surface you can seem
docile and amiable, but underneath you'll fight at the drop of a
hat. You are a born idealist and rebel, a radical, always on the side
of change, progress and novelty. You are an enthusiast in all matters,
and have little time for people that pussy foot around and seem to
lack conviction. Your interests are broad and sweeping...ideas,
philosophies, the arts. So you're inclined more to the professions or
the artistic, instead of a business career.
