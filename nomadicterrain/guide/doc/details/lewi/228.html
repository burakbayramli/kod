The essential personality outlook should be optimistic and positive. You will
tend to believe that there is always 'something good' waiting for you just
around the corner, a faith that your future will be rewarding. In some ways,
this can become a self-fulfilling prophecy; a positive mental attitude attracts
your dreams towards you, enabling their manifestation to proceed more smoothly.

<br/><br/>

There are likely to be sudden or surprising opporunities arising in your life,
which offer the potential of development and expansion. The opening of new
horizons can be personal, through relationships and family, educational, through
further study, or financial and business ventures. You may have to be ready to
take full advantage of these, as they can occur sometimes without any conscious
effort expended in creating new potential expressions.

<br/><br/>

You will be very attracted towards exploring human knowledge. You have an avid
curiosity; and you believe that all knowledge that you acquire offers more
mental freedom and interest, and more personal power, and greatly enriches life.

<br/><br/>

Often, you develop a personal programme for further study in specific areas of
enquiry. This is so you can gain some expertise, so that the information
absorbed can be used as a foundation and springboard to launch some kind of
project whereby you are able to exploit your own personal potential. You like to
create options and alternatives that you could follow, if you so choose, and
often mentally build a variety of potential schemes and projects. The problem
may lie in being able or willing to actually manifest any of them. Sometimes a
fertile mind can circle around a multitude of attractive ideas, yet fail to
develop any of them. A more one-pointed discipline may be required.

<br/><br/>

It is likely that in your quests for expansion and growth you will begin to ally
yourself with those more progressively minded people and groups devoted to
social change. New political thinking and social alternative lifestyles will
attract, especially as your bias will be against the estblished traditional
social order. You will have a reformist outlook, not excessively radical or
revolutionary, but still more future-directed than the majority. As an
independent thinker, you will serve as an advocate for new horizons in life; and
in sowing such seeds you can help to enrich lives by encouraging others to break
free of those limiting, stagnating patterns of life. You welcome the new and
unknown; you experience littler fear when the winds of change begin to blow, and
are ready to embrace their liberating influence.
