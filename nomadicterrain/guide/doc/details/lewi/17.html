<h3>17</h3>
<p>
You have a strong determined will, well defined opinions, and a very
forthright, honest, and fearless personality. There is much pride tied
up in your nature. You respect others, but you listen to yourself and
trust your personal abilities first and foremost. Not tending to rely
on your intellect alone, you depend more on your hunches, and your key
to success should be your high self-esteem. Creativity and pragmatism
mark your nature, giving you an excellent sense of how things should
be constructed, organized, or planned. You are a good manager or boss,
and people respond well to working for you. At your best you are
persistent, sure and reliable. Personal confidence and pride can at
times cause you to be domineering and inflexible in attitude, and you
possess strong likes and dislikes. Because you are usually so steady
and consistent, you rarely blow up. You can be critical, but in a fair
and constructive way. Wanting things done your way, you don't like to
have your action very closely monitored or scrutinized, although you
are not above doing this to others. Too your few close friends, you
are trustworthy, honest, and devoted. You seem to like or dislike
people because of instinctive feelings about them rather than for
matters you have reasoned out. This is a very fixed and stable
personality, but in the early part of your life you probably had
tendencies toward extremes. Throughout your life it will always be
important for you to double check decisions and avoid overestimating
possibilities because of confidence or pride. Behind the spirited, but
pridefully impulsive qualities in your personality is a practical,
solid, determined internal nature that serves you much better.
