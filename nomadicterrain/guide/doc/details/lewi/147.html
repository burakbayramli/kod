The emotional life is animated and excited with this aspect. People with Moon
conjunct Mars in their natal charts can actually feel warm. They're hot-blooded,
passionate, and sexual people. Most have considerable energy and intitiative at
their disposal. They are brave and spontaneous. There is an inherent pressure to
perform and to prove oneself on a personal level, which sometimes spills into
the professional arena, but taken alone, it points to a defensive nature that
doesn't easily relax.

<br/><br/>

There is a bluntness and straightforwardness to these people that is
unmistakable. Although they are completely ready to defend and protect their
loved ones, they are not especially sympathetic on a more personal
level. They'll most definitely defend the "weak", but they are too emotionally
excitable, self-absorbed, and brusque to be considered gentle and sympathetic
folk! They're brave and they value personal freedom. Routine bores them, and
they are inclined to seek out excitement in some form. Spontaneous to a fault,
these people react quickly to stimuli. They are usually physically
resilient. Their temper is quick, but it can disappear just as rapidly. Theirs
is a raw passion.

<br/><br/>

Moon conjunct Mars: You feel that you must always be DOING something,
and become impatient and irritable if you have to slow down or wait
for anything. A stormy home life may be the result of your own
tendency to fight for what you want, rather than compromise. You may
not realize how competitive you are.
