<h3>36</h3>
<p>
Your sign provides a high degree of what would be called a sixth sense
that always helps you get along in the world. This blending is one of
the most versatile and adaptable, but one in which frequent change and
inconstancy can be a problem, at times. Learning the difficult lesson
of concentration can be an early life challenge. You are highly
receptive and sensitive to the intangible vibrations around you, and
these will at least guide you along a path of survival. This
receptivity of mind encourages assimilation of knowledge, making it
possible for you to be well-informed on a variety of subjects, while
not really becoming an expert on any of them. Sometimes you have
trouble seeing things in true perspective because you are anything but
a realist. Even when your senses are wrong, it's hard to convince you
of the mistake. You have an illusory quality about you which keeps you
somewhat remote from the world. Your goals and ambitions are never
really high, but your creative and inventive abilities are
considerable. You are happiest when in a harmonious environment where
you can escape the various pressures and stresses of general business
life, for which you are temperamentally unsuited. Your best talents
center on the intellectual, literary, aesthetic or artistic, although
your versatility may open up opportunities for you in any number of
other areas. Your many talents notwithstanding, you may lack
self-confidence. You try to justify the motives for all your actions,
even when its not necessary that you do so. You have an innate feeling
that you are often misunderstood. You're very introspective, often
holding fixed ideas about yourself that may be at complete variance
with the facts. You have a quick perceptive mind when you aren't too
busy daydreaming. You have an instinctive hospitable nature, and this
nature has a good deal of sympathy and understanding for fellow
humans.
