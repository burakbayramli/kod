You have a good understanding of the "give and take" of life and are sensitive
to the needs of others. Anything that will benefit society as a whole has your
approval. You would find satisfaction in a career that allows you to touch the
lives of others.

<br/><br/>

You are a romantic at heart and very sensitive in love. You must have honesty in
your relationships and will accept nothing less. You are able to see through
others to their real motivations, so insincerity is not easy to hide from
you. Sometimes you can communicate with your lover without words, through
expressions, gestures or "vibes." You have strong emotional as well as physical
needs, but your partner must also be refined and respectable. You seem to simply
"know" things on a sexual level, which makes you an especially good lover. You
pick up even the subtlest of nuances, and this intuitive understanding and "soft
touch" is extremely attractive to many women. Your instinctive ability to be at
the right place at the right time assists you greatly in life. This inherent
spirituality can express itself well through the arts as well. Sexual fantasies
are especially strong. In your life, you may become attracted to spiritual forms
of sexuality, such as Tao and Tantra.

needs for both spiritual growth and physical achievement and can usually manage
to do both simultaneously.

uncomplicated yet stimulating love life and are a warm and tender lover. You are
honest and sincere with loved ones, although you are quick to cut ties if you
feel that interest is declining. The flush of romantic love may fade, but your
former lovers will always respect you. You can inspire your lover and bring much
joy into her life. You have a good understanding of the "give and take" of life
