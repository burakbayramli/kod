You are powerful and magnetic. You have a magical charm for dealing with
people. You have a universal love for people that is non-sectarian and
non-judgmental. You are sustained by material abundance that comes from others
at some time in this life and may have a sizable inheritance. When you get
involved with a project you can really pour yourself into it with seemingly
limitless energy. This energy evaporates when you aren't involved in a project
of personal importance.

Venus sextile Pluto or Venus trine Pluto: *You love deeply, passionately, and
wholeheartedly, and others may find your intensity either extremely attractive
or threatening. You are charismatic and can have a powerful emotional influence
on others, especially those of the opposite sex. You may use your attractiveness
to manipulate others, sometimes without even realizing it.

<br/><br/>

This aspect deepens your response to love, people and life in general. You have
the rare quality of seeing the best in everyone, thus helping to bring it
out. Beauty, symmetry and goodness are the things you look for in life - and
find! Your friends come from all social classes and backgrounds. Your
understanding and appreciation of love is instinctive, and you are fully
prepared to accept the responsibilities of love as well as the joys.

<br/><br/>

Your powerful artistic gifts can provide the media for your spiritual
expression. Sometimes you are driven by physical compulsion to produce tangible
works.
