<h3>126</h3>
<p>
You are very outstanding in anything that requires critical and
analytical ability, for you indeed have a great intelligence and true
mental prowess. You are believable and sincere; a person who gives
excellent sound advice, usually in a very matter-of-fact way. You plan
precisely, and proceed with confidence and assurance. You insist on
taking your time in the thought processes, and you rarely ever go off
half-cocked. This combination blends a friendliness, originality and
independence that is Aquarius, with the discrimination, precision and
practical abilities of Virgo. Both signs are noted for producing
intelligence, reason and logic. The blended personality is neat,
careful and prudent, and shows a persistence toward learning and
concentration on detail; there is the ability to detach yourself from
personal issues, and focus on the problem that you have at
hand. Emotions never interfere with your thinking because of your
ability to face facts and to reason things out with a keen critical
analysis. Hence, you don't make many mistakes. You are somewhat
fastidious in your tastes, neat and orderly, and perhaps particular in
dress. Your ability to analyze gives you an intuitive insight into
peoples feelings, but your responses are largely restrained, and you
come across as being somewhat aloof. Demonstration of affection may
need cultivation at times to assure harmony and happiness. You have a
great deal of potential in business because of your ability to marshal
facts and important information relating to scientific matters, and
apply your knowledge in a practical endeavor.
