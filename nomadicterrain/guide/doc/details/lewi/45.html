<h3>45</h3>
<p>
Your sign blends the contradictory elements of caution, tenacity, and
a need for security, with the much more outgoing Sagittarius tendency
to be outgoing and independent. This pairing gives you a more sociable
and progressive demeanor. You can relate to generalities and ideals,
but on a more real and practical basis. You can inspire confidence in
people. In your relations with others you demand absolute
honesty. When you detect falsity and insincerity in your dealings with
people, the sensitive and defensive side of your nature quickly
appears. Petty jealousies and trite behavior repels you. You live more
or less by your own set of rules, often trying to live up to some
ideal or idol you have set up as a goal or inspiration. You are
innately the philosopher in the way that you look at life and consider
those around you. In many ways, you are a true "free spirit." While
you are extremely polite and tactful, you seem to have no difficulty
being firm and definite. Communication is frank, open, and no one has
to wonder where you stand on an issue. Weakness or timidity is rarely
a problem with this placement.
