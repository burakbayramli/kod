<h3>Snake</h3>
<p>
Diplomatic and popular, the Snake has the sensual art of seduction down. This 
Sign is an interesting mix of gregariousness paired with introversion, intuitive 
reasoning paired with savvy business skills. Snakes are considered to be lucky 
with money and will generally have more than enough to live life to the fullest, 
regardless of how important it considers money to be; this may be due to the 
fact that Snakes tend to be rather tight with cash. They're not stingy, they're 
simply more mentally than physically active. Snakes tend to hang back a bit in 
order to analyze a situation before jumping into it. Their charming, seductive 
quality actually belies a rather retiring nature; this Sign is perfectly happy 
to spend the whole day curled up with a good book and, thus, can be mislabeled 
as being lazy.

The Snake is somewhat insecure deep down and tend to be a rather jealous, 
possessive lover, behavior that can end up alienating loved ones. Despite these 
less-than-stellar tendencies, however, the Snake often proves irresistible and 
is a generous, loving partner.. Slightly dangerous and disarmingly smart, the 
Snake's philosophical and intuitive mind generally supersedes logic in favor of 
feelings and instinct. Snakes will rely on their own gut reactions and 
intuitions before turning to others for suggestions. This makes this Sign a 
great hand in any business venture, possessing the caution and smarts needed to 
get ahead.

Snakes are hard workers (when they see good reason to be!) and are possessed of 
a keen intelligence. Snakes have incredible follow-through, once they get going, 
and they expect the same from others. Thus, their coworkers and employees had 
best stay on their toes, lest they anger the Snake and suffer its poisonous 
bite! 

<br/><br/>
 
In general, of course, Snakes are generous and genteel, charming and 
appealing. Snakes must try to learn humility and to develop a stronger sense of 
self. Once Snakes realize that confidence comes from within, they will finally 
be comfortable in their own skin.

The most compatible match for a Snake is the Rooster or the Ox.
