<h3>Dragon</h3>
<p>
The Dragon is one of the most powerful and lucky Signs of the Chinese 
Zodiac. Its warm heart makes the Dragon's brash, fiery energy far more 
palatable. This is a giving, intelligent and tenacious Sign that knows exactly 
what it wants and is determined to get it. Dragons possess a certain natural, 
charming charisma that ensures they can always influence their peers and often 
find themselves the center of attention in social situations. This Sign is truly 
blessed, too; Dragons are considered to be very lucky in love! The Dragon's 
friends are always keen to hear what this firebrand has to say and when it comes 
to dispensing advice, the Dragon has the floor.

Its ego can get in the Dragon's way, but even so, this larger-than-life creature 
has a knack for initiating projects and keeping the troops motivated. According 
to Dragons, it's their natural born right to lead the way -- because who else 
could do it so surely and so well? As lucky as they are, Dragons have a good 
chance of achieving considerable material wealth during their lifetimes, 
although it isn't mere money that's this Sign's main motivation. Power is what 
the Dragon wants and truly believes it deserves. Dragons are quite the 
opportunists, forever searching for ways in which to consolidate their 
considerable power. Contrary to all this strength and fire, a weakened Dragon is 
a sad sack, a creature that refuses to take defeat with even a modicum of grace.

The role of leader is the only one the Dragon wants, the better from which to 
give orders and be king of the hill. They make solid leaders, too, knowing 
instinctively what needs to be done to stay on top. Crossing the Dragon is never 
a good idea -- this beast can singe! A valuable life lesson for this clever 
creature would be to absorb the principles of flexibility, compassion and 
tolerance. Being high and mighty can serve to inspire others, but it also keeps 
Dragons from living their lives to the fullest. If Dragons can learn to balance 
their quest for success with an appreciation for the little things, their life 
will be more than worthwhile.

The most compatible match for a Dragon is the Monkey or the Rat.
