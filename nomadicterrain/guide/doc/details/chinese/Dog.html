<h3>Dog</h3>
<p>
In the West, the Dog is man's best friend, but in Chinese Astrology this Sign is
a little more unpredictable than that. Dogs are loyal, faithful and honest and
always stick to their firm codes of ethics. However, this Sign has trouble
trusting others. It's generally quite trustworthy itself -- except for the
occasional "little white lies" the Dog tells in order to make things go more
smoothly. The Dog makes a wonderful, discreet and loyal friend (despite any
white lies) and is an excellent listener. This Sign tends to root for the
underdog and its keen sense of right and wrong makes it duty-bound to the
core. The Dog's mantra seems to be, Live right, look out for the little people
and fight injustice whenever possible.

Dogs can also be rather dogmatic, too. They don't go in for light social banter;
instead, they go straight for home, expostulating on the topics that are most
important to them. At these times the Dog's narrow-minded or stubborn side can
become apparent; this Sign has trouble staying light and calm when an important
issue is at stake. This Sign can also be very temperamental; mood swings
characterize its emotional life and often the Dog needs to run off to be alone
in order to recuperate. Part of the problem is the result of this Sign's load of
irrational fears that turn into niggling anxieties that turn into hurt feelings
and occasional grouchiness. This sensitive Sign needs to warm up to others over
time and gradually learn to trust them. Without that trust as a foundation, Dogs
can be judgmental and coarse.

The Dog's discerning nature does make it an excellent business person, one who
can turn that picky, guarded nature into a keen sense of the truth of another's
motives. Where love is concerned, Dogs often have a tough time finding the right
match. They can be so anxious and overwrought in the romance dance that they'll
stress their partner to the max! In any forum, this Sign is happiest when able
to be quite physically active; at home or at work, the Dog will always be
constructing something new or cleaning something up in order to make things
better. Dogs need to work on controlling their irrational worries and would also
be well-served to relax their mile-high standards, which can sometimes wind up
alienating the ones they love.

The most compatible match for a Dog is the Tiger or the Horse.
