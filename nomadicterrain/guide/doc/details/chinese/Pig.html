<h3>Pig</h3>
<p>
Contrary to its rather negative reputation in the West, the Pig of Chinese 
Astrology may be the most generous and honorable Sign of the Zodiac. Pigs are 
nice to a fault and possess impeccable manners and taste. They have so much of 
the perfectionist in them that others may be inclined to perceive them as snobs, 
but this is a misconception. Pigs are simply possessed of a truly luxurious 
nature, one that delights in finery and riches (in surroundings, food, 
lovemaking and otherwise). This Sign believes in the best qualities of mankind 
and certainly doesn't consider itself to be superior. Pigs also care a great 
deal about friends and family and work hard to keep everyone in their life 
happy. Helping others is a true pleasure for the Pig, who feels best when 
everyone else is smiling.

A Pig with no one around to appreciate its giving nature is a sad sight. Pigs 
are so magnanimous they can appear almost saintly; this can lead some 
less-than-well-intentioned souls to stomp all over this Sign, and the bad news 
is, the Pig will take the blows! Pigs make great companions in part because of 
their refusal to see the more negative or base qualities in a partner, but that 
rose-colored view can lead to this Sign's allowing itself to be taken advantage 
of. Contrary to their seemingly benign dispositions, however, Pigs can be quite 
venomous in response to being crossed by a lover, friend or business partner.

Pigs are highly intelligent creatures, forever studying, playing and probing in 
their quest for greater knowledge. They can be misinterpreted as being lazy, 
however, due to their love of reveling in the good stuff; this Sign could 
happily spend hours on end making love, napping, taking a long bubble bath or 
dallying over an incredible spread of rich foods. Pigs tend to make wonderful 
life partners due to their hearts of gold and their love of family. Even so, 
Pigs can be rather exclusive, choosing to spend time with those who will 
appreciate them most and ignore the rest of the populace. Pigs would do well to 
realize that there's more to life than being needed. When they open up their 
world to a diverse group of people, they will truly bloom.

The most compatible match for a Pig is the Rabbit or the Goat.
