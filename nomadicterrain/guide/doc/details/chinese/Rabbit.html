<h3>Rabbit</h3>
<p>
Timid and attractive, the Rabbits of the Chinese Zodiac tend to act more like 
bunnies, whether they like it or not! This Sign is extremely popular and has a 
wide circle of family and friends. Its compassionate nature leads it to be very 
protective of those it holds dear, but where romance is concerned, the Rabbit's 
sentimentality can lead it to idealize relationships. The sweet, sensitive 
Rabbit often ends up giving more of itself to a partner than is realistic or 
healthy. The good news is, when this Sign goes off-balance, the Rabbit's core 
group of friends and its stable home life help bring it back to center.

The Rabbit is a rather delicate Sign that needs a solid base in order to 
thrive. Lacking close, supportive friends and family, the Rabbit might just 
break down in tears at the first sign of conflict. Emotional upsets in this 
Sign's life can even lead to physical illnesses. Rabbits dislike arguments and 
other conflict and will try anything to avoid a fight; this results in something 
of a pushover nature. Rabbits can also lapse into pessimism and may seem stuck 
in life -- often to mask their insecure natures. Rabbits tend to move through 
life's lessons at their own, rather contemplative pace; it's a waste of time to 
become exasperated with this Sign's seeming disinterest in facing its problems 
and conquering them.

With the right partner -- meaning someone whose high principles won't allow it 
to take advantage of this sensitive, giving Sign -- the Rabbit can make an 
incredibly loving and protective partner or family member. Rabbits love to 
entertain at home and always make sure their house is comfortable and 
tastefully-furnished. What Rabbits need most is a stronger sense of self-worth 
and the security that comes with it. Their discerning natures, coupled with some 
hard-won assertiveness, will help these happy creatures go far.

The most compatible match for a Rabbit is the Goat or the Pig.
