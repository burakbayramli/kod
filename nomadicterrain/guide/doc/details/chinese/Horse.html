<h3>Horse</h3>
<p>
Thank goodness for open spaces, because the Horse needs plenty of room to roam! 
Energetic, good with money and very fond of travel, Horses are the nomads of the 
Chinese Zodiac, roaming from one place or project to the next. All of this 
Sign's incessant activity and searching may be to satisfy a deep-rooted desire 
to fit in. Paradoxically, Horses feel a simultaneous yearning for independence 
and freedom. 

<br/><br/>
 
Horses crave love and intimacy, which is a double-edged sword since it often 
leads them to feel trapped. Love connections tend to come easily to Horses, 
since they exude the kind of raw sex appeal that is a magnet to others. This 
Sign tends to come on very strong in the beginning of the relationship, having 
an almost innate sense of romance and seduction. Horses are seducers in general; 
check out any A-list party and you're bound to find the Horse in 
attendance. This Sign possesses a sharp wit and a scintillating presence; it 
really knows how to work a crowd. Surprisingly, Horses tend to feel a bit 
inferior to their peers, a misconception that causes them to drift from group to 
group out of an irrational fear of being exposed as a fraud. 

<br/><br/>
 
An impatient streak can lead Horses to be less than sensitive to others' 
needs. These colts would rather take a situation firmly in hand as opposed to 
waiting for others to weigh in or come to terms with it. The lone wolf inside 
the Horse can at times push others away, but this also makes this Sign stronger 
and is a key to its success. Horses are self-reliant and, though they might lose 
interest fast in a tedious, nine-to-five day job, are willing to do the work 
necessary to get ahead. 

<br/><br/>
 
Horses tend not to look much at the big picture; instead they just follow their 
whims, which can result in a trail of prematurely ended relationships, jobs, 
projects and so on. This Sign really knows how to motivate others, though, and 
get a lot accomplished. Once they find some peace within themselves, they can 
curb their wandering tendencies and learn to appreciate what's in their own 
backyard. 

<br/><br/>
 
The most compatible match for a Horse is the Dog or the Tiger.
