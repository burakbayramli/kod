<h3>Rooster</h3>

<p>
The Rooster is the strutting peacock of the Chinese Zodiac! These quick thinkers 
are practical and resourceful, preferring to stick to what is tried and true 
rather than taking messy, unnecessary risks. Roosters are keenly observant. It's 
hard to slip anything past a Rooster, since they seem to have eyes in the backs 
of their heads! This quality can lead others to think the Rooster is psychic, 
but that's not generally the case; instead, this Sign enjoys a keen attention to 
detail that makes it a whiz at anything requiring close analysis. Roosters make 
great lawyers, brain surgeons and accountants, to name a few of this Sign's 
possible occupations. Above all else, the Rooster is very straightforward and 
rewards others' honesty in kind. 

<br/><br/>
 
Roosters aren't shifty or cagey and have no interest in hiding behind a 
facade. They are the proverbial open book, telling the truth and keeping their 
word. If you show your hand, the Rooster will respect you for it. This kind of 
trusting behavior can tempt tricksters to pull a fast one on the Rooster, but 
that would be a bad move! Remember, this Sign doesn't indulge in flights of 
fancy and keeps those eyes wide open at all times. 

<br/><br/>
 
Roosters tend to be perfectionists and expect to be in control, especially over 
their appearance. Primping and posing for the Rooster can go on forever! Being 
noticed and admired is an aphrodisiac for Roosters, and they can go a long time 
on a few kind words. Roosters also adore being out on the town, especially if 
they're in the company of adoring friends. The Rooster will also be the 
best-dressed one of the bunch -- style counts with this Sign, regardless of the 
cost. 

<br/><br/>
 
Roosters also expect to be in control of their surroundings, including whoever 
happens to be in those surroundings. Roosters keep an impeccably neat house and 
expect their lovers, housemates and family members to maintain the same high 
standards of dress and conduct as they do. This can cause problems with other, 
more relaxed types who just want to be accepted as is. The Rooster needs the 
right partner, one who understands this Sign's basically conservative 
nature. With the right person, the Rooster can be the most loyal, trusting and 
supportive mate around, one who bends over backward to please its loved 
ones. Some Signs may just end up feeling hen-pecked, however. 

<br/><br/>
 
Roosters need to learn to value their heart and soul as much as their good 
looks. Their excellent people skills and sharp minds are qualities that others 
will appreciate as much as a pretty face. This Sign would also do well to learn 
to adopt the philosophy of "live and let live"; perhaps an appeal to the 
Rooster's logic -- that it's inefficient to waste time nagging others -- will 
help this Sign learn to let others be whomever and however they are.

The most compatible match for a Rooster is the Ox or the Snake.
