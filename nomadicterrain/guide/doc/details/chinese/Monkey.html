<h3>Monkey</h3>
<p>
The spunky Monkey is the original party animal! Charming and energetic, Monkeys 
crave fun, activity and stimulation. They truly know how to have a good time and 
can often be seen swinging from one group of friends to another, attracting a 
motley crew in the process. Always upbeat, they are considered minor celebrities 
in their circle thanks to their sparkling wit and that rapier-sharp 
mind. Perhaps surprisingly, Monkeys are also good listeners and tackle 
complicated situations with ease. This Sign's natural curiosity lends it the 
desire to become knowledgeable on a broad range of topics. Monkeys have a 
show-off side that loves nothing more than to dazzle their pals with all they 
know. 

<br/><br/>
 
The Monkey tends to be rather accident-prone due to a certain lack of very high 
morals. This Sign's first interest is pursuing its own pleasure; this is not a 
malicious interest, it's just the way the Monkey is. However, this kind of 
carefree self-involvement can lead to all kinds of scrapes. In love, the Monkey 
makes a fun, exciting lover -- but one that may have the potential to stray 
romantically. The good news is, the Monkey's glib manner and witty repartee can 
often get this Sign out of a scrape. Perhaps not everyone will be won over by 
the Monkey -- but do you think the Monkey really cares? The Monkey's world, full 
of devil-may-care energy and revelry, isn't for everyone. Remember, though, it's 
not that this Sign is mean; it might just be a bit too curious for its own 
good. Monkeys often feel the need to try everything at least once, which can 
make for a merry-go-round of relationships. 

<br/><br/>
 
The Monkey's love of self-indulgence can also lead to other types of 
trouble. This Sign may have limited self-control concerning food, alcohol and 
other pleasurable activities. It's party time all the time for the Monkey, yet 
when it leads to a monster hangover or a shattered heart (generally someone 
else's, not theirs), this Sign might actually show a touch of remorse. They 
won't flat-out admit the error of their ways, but at least they'll pull back and 
try to tone things down -- for a while. 

<br/><br/>
 
Monkeys must try to learn to think of others ahead of themselves, at least some 
of the time. This Sign's world will be more complete once it realizes the world 
doesn't revolve around it.

The most compatible match for a Monkey is the Rat or the Dragon.
