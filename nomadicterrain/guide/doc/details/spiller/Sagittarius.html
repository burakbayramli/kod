    The Achilles Heel of whose these people is their need for mental
    security. "If I can understand what other people think and say the right
    thing that will make them to agree with me, I will always feel happy". This
    can lead them to a trap of unending quest for more information, and is
    unfruitful, because they can never understand other people thoughts to a
    degree that will help him say the right thing. They need to let go of
    control and trust their instincts, to pay attention to their <i>own</i>
    reality. When they do that, this will bring forth their honesty, which in
    turn, help them find the happiness and security they need.
