<h3>Capricorn</h3>
<p>

  <h5>Traits to Focus On</h5>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Being in control of self</li>
    <li>Being an adult</li>
    <li>Self respect</li>
    <li>Being goal oriented</li>
    <li>Solving problems logically, analytically</li>
    <li>Fullfilling promises</li>
    <li>Letting go of the past</li>
    <li>Taking care of self</li>
    <li>Accepting responsibility in order to succeed</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <h5>Traits to Leave Behind</h5>
  <p>      
    <ul>
    <li>Limiting oneself due to fears</li>
    <li>Isolating oneself, spending too much time at home</li>
    <li>Losing self respect to the point of immobility</li>
    <li>Using the past as an escape from, or a shield against today</li>
    <li>Being edgy, whimsical for no apparent reason</li>
    <li>Being too dependent on other people</li>
    <li>Lack of self-respect</li>
    <li>Avoiding personal risk</li>
    <li>Trying to control others through emotional responses, outbursts</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  Achilles Heel of these people is dependence. The need of being looked after
  can force these people in a unending quest for security. They develop
  attachements, dependence on other people, forcing them to be the center of
  their security. But this is a bottomless hole. This person must accept
  responsibility, be willing to take risks and take responsibility for managing
  and reaching their goals on something. These people long for a sense of
  belonging but they need to understand a special person or a group will not
  provide this just because of their need. Instead, they must take
  responsibility of creating that which they have a need for.

<p>
North Node in Capricorn represents your soul mission, according to
karmic astrology. Capricorn symbolically represents the EMOTIONAL
RESPONSES, ATTITUDES and ENERGY to adopt and explore throughout your
life.
</p>

<p>
There are THREE STEPS you can use to consciously attract a soulmate.
</p>
<p>
Step one: Appreciate your Cancer talents
</p>
<p>
Your vulnerability and home-loving nurturing side is natural to you
</p>

<p>
The first step in claiming your North Node in Capricorn is to embody
the highest expression of Cancer (opposite to Capricorn). Cancer
represents your karmic past. So definitely appreciate - but! Don't
make your Cancer qualities the centre of your life.
</p>

<p>
Celebrate your nurturing, sensitive side, your desire to protect those
you love and your ability to create a secure home. Prepare yummy food
and love your kitchen. Enjoy the quiet of nature and time on the water
and allow it to feed your creativity. Explore your maternal side. Be a
great mom (or sweet dad) if you have kids. Value the family you've
created (this includes soul family).
</p>

<p>
Study Cancer to understand its highest potential, and choose to live
that, holding Libra ever so lightly.
</p>

<p>
This is your first step to consciously attracting your soulmate.
</p>

<p>
Step two: Own your Cancer karma
</p>

<p>
Careful of moodiness, using family as an excuse and clinging to the past
</p>

<p>
With a North Node in Capricorn, your karma is around how you've used
emotion to manipulate, control or smother others. There's also karma
around codependence in relationships, or needing to be needed. In this
lifetime, you are to cease seeing the world through rose-coloured
glasses and step into a life of true responsibility.
</p>

<p>
In past lifetimes, you were a mom, a stay at home wife, a sailor, a
chef or cook, or an abandoned child. You might have been an overly
emotional and dependent woman, or one who had an unhealthy desire to
be needed. Have you attracted emotional, depressed, child-like people
in your life? There's your clue!
</p>

<p>
The shadow side of Cancer has to do with emotional dependencies and a
fear of leaving the nest. Funny thing, when you do willingly take on
more responsibility, your emotional needs are taken care of.
</p>


<p>
Step three: Step into your Capricorn soul mission
</p>

<p>
Create traditions. Cultivate logic. Wear earth tones (your soul
colour)
</p>

<p>
Capricorn is supremely grounded, the rock that others count on. It has
impeccable integrity, a business-like attitude and excels at using
material resources. It's conservative, traditional, economical and
great at managing money. With a North Node in Capricorn soul mission,
you are to channel your natural heart energy into building something
that others can use. You're here to willingly shoulder great
responsibility and (possibly) leave a legacy in the world.
</p>

<p>
No matter how foreign this sounds to you, this is the energy to step
into over the course of your lifetime. In past Cancer lifetimes, you
have fully developed your ability to know and express your maternal
vulnerability. A North Node in Capricorn asks you to step into
spiritual adulthood, outside the nest. Capricorn works on a number of
levels:
</p>

<p>
First, as father to yourself
</p>

<p>
Then (possibly) as father to another
</p>

<p>
Finally, as the universal father who offers wisdom, support and
shelter for the children of this earth who need it.
</p>

<p>
If you want to know how to attract your soulmate, explore honour,
tradition and integrity. Also, focus on being emotionally stable,
logical and impeccably dependable. More than any other sign, Capricorn
indicates a relationship based on traditional values (your preference,
of course).
</p>

<p>
Be impeccably loyal, because Capricorn is also a rock-solid and
reliable friend. Your soulmate will help you bring out your strong,
silent side and - and will also love your private soft heart as well.
</p>

<p>
  The house where your Capricorn soul mission expresses itself, is the
  area of life where you will most benefit from willingly taking on
  great responsibility. It's also where you may leave a legacy.

North Node Capricorn, South Node Cancer
</p>


<p>
Integrity is the key to your life. By following your personal code of
ethics and beliefs you have an inner compass for your life. As you
develop self-control and self-care while approaching life in a goal
oriented manner, you integrate the lessons of your past and bring your
dreams into reality. In former lives, or earlier in this one, you were
more concerned with the process of life rather than your goals and
visions, and were overly immersed in your emotional life. At times you
succumbed to moodiness and a dependence on others that was not
healthy. Now you are learning to truly be the author of your life: the
"author-ity" and are finding the satisfactions of independence.  By
setting positive and reachable goals, and taking the steady steps to
reach them, you release old fears of rejection and find that you have
what it takes to be a leader and a person in authority.
</p>

<p>
This may feel quite new, as you may have spent other lifetimes in
which you were a householder and identified with your role in your
family and clan. You may still have some difficult family karma to
resolve, but you're willing and able to do what needs to be done. You
are not one to be irresponsible and you are not naive either.  In this
life you are called to be a builder, a creator, and a preserver of all
that is valuable. You have a deep respect for the good part of
traditions that have been handed down, and you may find yourself given
the opportunity to succeed in the world in a surprising way. Others
see your integrity, and trust that you can be the person of authority.
</p>

<p>
Because of your innate seriousness and strong work ethic you can
sometimes feel isolated from others, so make it a point to find ways
to lightly and creatively express yourself, as well as finding loyal
friends to cheer and encourage you. You are more respected and loved
than you realize.
</p>

<p>
As you pick up the gold in your Cancer South Node, you'll find that
any left-over tendencies to control others by emotional over reactions
and manipulations will fall away as you come into your own. You have a
keen sense of intuition and yet you may feel at times as if you are
blocked, or don't want to open up fully to all your
emotions--sometimes it feels like dangerous territory. Trust your
intuitions, and go at your own pace.
</p>

<p>
Soul Purpose: Building a life, a business or career, or some structure
that is worthy of your ambition. You are "toughening" into becoming an
Elder and a wise one, but you need to mature into it by wise use of
solitude and a savvy attitude in the world. You are leaving behind a
family oriented dependence and moving out into the public world. You
could become a high achiever and successful in whatever field you
choose, but remember to "be in the world, but not of it."
</p>

<p>
Shadow: Not setting up appropriate boundaries between your self and
family members or business partners. The goal is inter-dependence with
others, and an outward looking perspective that still honors the
integrity you deeply understand. Never forget the old Biblical saying:
"What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but lose his
immortal Soul?"
</p>

<p>
You are learning how to achieve maturity.  In prior lifetimes, you
tended to see life through rose-colored glasses and to deny everything
else.  Much of the "child" may still be with you.  In prior lifetimes,
you wrestled with your dependencies while, at the same time, seeking
something to lean on.  Now, your life may be characterized by
struggles with this childlike behavior, which repeatedly impedes your
growth into maturity.  You seek means to maintain the focus of your
parents' attention; you had rather your parents solve the problems
than do so yourself.  Friends, business associates, marriage
partner—all become a symbolic parent to whom you look to pick up the
pieces of your life, to protect you from the results of your own
behavior.  You are capable of creating your own illness if it holds
the potential of gaining love and affection.
</p>

<p>
You may constantly practice becoming an adult; yet, you never feel
quite ready to make the transition.  All that you do this lifetime is
based on soul memories of "sensitive past-life feelings which still
are shattered by the slightest rejection."
</p>

<p>
You may be "strongly wrapped up" in the business of your country.  You
tend to personalize government; for to you, it is part of your own
family.  You are very patriotic and loyal.
</p>

<p>
You may enjoy working with young people and listening to the problems
of others.  The problem comes when you attempt to hold all their
problems inside of you.  This can create early aging.
</p>

<p>
The most difficult karmic lesson with CANCER SOUTH NODE is learning to
let go.  You have soul memories of having lost or forgotten something
important; now you attempt to hang onto to everything.  You may
constantly be thinking in terms of what you should have done "years
ago or lives ago."
</p>

<p>
You are likely to be extremely draining to others, using whatever they
do for you as the springboard to ask for more.  "[You] are not so much
interested in finding out why something went wrong as [you] are
seeking the lost feeling to be returned."  It is especially hard for
you to see a relationship end.
</p>

<p>
As your CAPRICORN NORTH NODE's magnetic pull attracts you, you must
find an ideal bigger than yourself; you must learn to stand for
something and accept true responsibility.  As you do so, you may tend
to adopt a traditional stance and work to prevent others from seeing
anything in your life expression that contradicts that stance.
Although maintaining this stance is difficult (because in truth you
are not free to be yourself), you can assist others by giving them a
model and ideal.
</p>

<p>
Women with these NODES feel a strong urge to seek a father figure.
Men feel driven to be a good father.
</p>

<p>
"The most important thing about the CAPRICORN NORTH NODE is that it
represents the point through which [you] will meet [your] karmic
mission."  For this reason, you may tend to remain immature as long as
possible-you sense a kind of judgment approaching.  You may have
difficulty accepting your chronological age.  You may admit it, but
try hard not to live it.
</p>

<p>
Capricorn is the gateway through which the Accepted Disciple
walks toward Ascension.  It is the energy of initiation into
Higher Consciousness; therefore, your struggles signify
opportunities to balance past life karma and move on
unencumbered.  You may tend to flounder the first half of
your life, then one day realize that you have matured, that
you have, after all, done something worthwhile with your
life.

<p>
Here are a few Cancer sign south node traits that should be put to
rest, sort of speak, if the individual with this nodal position is to
live an emotionally rich life:
</p>

<p>
Overly-sensitive, crabby, manipulative, obsessed with past, clingy,
childish, overly-reserved, smothering, insecure, negative, easily
hurt.
</p>

<p>
Here are a few Capricorn sign north node traits that this individual
might at first find foreign but eventually will need to embrace if he
is to connect to his true soul potential and live the life he was
meant to live:
</p>

<p>
Self-sufficient, responsible, wise, ambitious, hardworking,
conservative, meticulous, enterprising, economical, disciplined,
committed, goal-oriented.
</p>

<p>
The journey from a Cancer sign south node to a Capricorn sign north
node will not be easy. But then again, neither is anything else in
life that's worth doing.
</p>

<p>
Obstacles are simply strategically placed hurdles meant to remind us
of our inner strength and hidden needs. Therefore, as long as the
Capricorn sign north node individual remembers that his soul is
creating the kind of life he needs in order to evolve as a spiritual
individual, he will make it through the transformation just fine.
</p>

<p>
The following are some of the hurdles that the Capricorn north node
individual must overcome in order to live up to his potential;
</p>

<br/>
He must learn how to become a mature individual; responsible for his
actions and able to take care of his own needs
<br/>
He must stop living behind rose-colored glasses
<br/>
He must stop being overly-dependent on others
<br/>
He must realize that clinging to the past will no longer provide the
comfort and nurturance he so desperately needs
<br/>
He must understand that certain un-welcomed life events are simply
there to help him transform from a "child" to an adult
<br/>
He must protect himself from absorbing the problems of the world
because all they do is drain him of his life force
<br/>
He must learn to let go
<br/>
He must learn to accept loss and find peace in the creation of his
present
<br/>
<br/>
For only when the Capricorn sign north individual masters the lessons
mentioned above, will he be able to create the existence he seeks.
<br/>
<br/>
The north node path is offering the Capricorn sign soul an opportunity
to acquire wisdom, strength, and self-reliance. However, it is still
up to the individual to decide whether he will accept the gift. Having
said all that, it might not be such a bad idea for the Capricorn sign
soul to surround himself with as many people and symbols that can
support his journey. By encircling himself with people who understand
him and symbols that exude the Capricorn sign energy, he invites the
support needed to follow his internal voice and path to fulfillment.

<p>
A tendency to be overly attached to our childhood and past, to be
dependent on others and avoid accepting responsibility for our lives,
to fear rejection to an extreme thereby missing opportunities, and to
be overly focused on emotional problems are some of the issues this
position suggests. With this position, we need to take charge of our
lives and accept responsibility for our actions. We may too easily
blame our past or focus on our insecurities and emotional difficulties
instead of moving forward and learning to depend on ourselves. We want
to feel secure more than anything, but security can only come once we
let go of our dependencies and carve out a life that reflects a true
feeling of responsibility to ourselves as well as to others. We are
more aware of our emotions than most people, but in order to grow, we
must learn to strike a balance between sensitivity and
responsibility. We cannot use our sensitivity as a crutch, although we
may spend the first half of our life trying to do so! Recognition will
come, at some point in our journey, that clinging to the comforts of
childhood will in fact hold us back from achieving a comfortable
future! By defining solid goals and a mature direction in our lives,
as well as letting go of some of our over-attachment to our childhood,
we will be able to achieve the financial and emotional security that
we so crave.
