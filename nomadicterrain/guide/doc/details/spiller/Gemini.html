    The Achilles Heel of such people is their obsessiveness with being always
    right. This tendency might push them toward a unending quest of seeking "The
    Truth", but this is an unfruitful undertaking. Since it is impossible to be
    right all the time, this person never feels happiness. If, however, they
    become modest and humble enough to be open to other people, to their outlook
    and their ideas which might not match to their experience, they can get to
    know people better and other's like him for it. This person needs to drop
    his quest for "absolute Truth", but instead form relationships with people
    as they are, start learning from them and listening to them.
