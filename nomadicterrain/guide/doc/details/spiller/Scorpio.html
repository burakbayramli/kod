    Achilles Heel for Comfort Zone people is, well, their comfort, their
    lax attitude to life. Their ultimate goal in life is to be relaxed and own
    things. But this person will never own enough things to make them feel
    "relaxed". Their need to be in high energy situation and must let their lax
    attitude go. They need to focus on partnering with others instead of
    focusing too much on themselves, their comfort. Irony is when they partner
    with someone else, this relationship can make them rich.
