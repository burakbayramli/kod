    The Achilles Heel of these people is looking for their sense of self worth
    through others' approval. They need to give up on getting themselves tangled
    up in other people's doings and focus on themselves, walk on their own
    path. These people look for a co-dependent relationship, but first, they
    must understand his/her own needs, to distinquish self, then get into the
    relationship.

<p>
North Node in Taurus represents your soul mission, according to karmic
astrology. Taurus symbolically represents the EMOTIONAL RESPONSES,
ATTITUDES and ENERGY to adopt and explore throughout your life.
</p>

<p>
There are THREE STEPS you can use to consciously attract a soulmate.
</p>

<p>
Step one: Appreciate your Scorpio talents
</p>

<p>
Sexual and emotional intimacy is natural to you
</p>

<p>
The first step in claiming your North Node in Taurus is to embody the
highest expressions of Scorpio (opposite to Taurus) representing your
karmic past. So definitely appreciate - but! Don't make your intense
Scorpio qualities the centre of your life.
</p>

<p>
Celebrate your intense, sensual side, and joyfully use your innate
investigative skill, and plumbing the depths of life. Enjoy sexuality,
and the magnetic, smoldering way you attract others. Enjoy unraveling
mysteries, and remain passionately loyal to those you care about.
</p>

<p>
Study Scorpio to understand its highest potential, and choose to live
that, holding Scorpio ever so lightly.
</p>

<p>
This is your first step to consciously attracting your soulmate.
</p>

<p>
Step two: Own your Scorpio karma
</p>

<p>
Careful not to get off on suffering and emotional chaos
</p>

<p>
With a North Node in Taurus, your karma is around how you've used and
mis-used power. You may have learned early to deal with death, or
other dark or transformational experiences in yourself or others. You
may have also experienced dramatic changes (drama!) and today, you are
always on the verge of violently cutting ties.
</p>

<p>
In past lifetimes, you might have been a psychiatrist, detective, a
magician, a financial advisor, a CEO, a mortician, a surgeon, a
prostitute, a sex addict, or someone who has abused power or betrayed
others. Do you perpetrate or experience betrayal? Attract power
struggles? Bingo!
</p>

<p>
This shadow side of Scorpio has to do with entangling our own self
worth and values with significant others. It also means attracting
emotional chaos (as a sense of aliveness) instead of cultivating peace
and serenity.
</p>

<p>
  Step three: Step into your Taurus soul mission
</p>

<p>
  Establish your values. Create security. Wear green (your soul
  colour)
</p>

<p>
A fully expressed North Node in Taurus is sensual, and loves the
comforts of life, scents and touch. It's practically creative, often
the singer, photographer, gardener, farmer, architect, and builds upon
a deep inner foundation. It's also great at making (and managing)
money, growing its net worth through its own efforts.
</p>

<p>
  Does this not sound like you at all? That's perfect! I'm here to
  tell you that if you consciously adopt these qualities, you'll
  experience incredible growth and serendipity. You'll be on the path
  to your soul mission, and be walking where your soulmate lives too.
</p>

<p>
North node in Taurus is about achieving true self-reliance. In this
lifetime, it is imperative that you not get enmeshed in the ways of
others. In fact, I'd even say: put your values before another's.
</p>

<p>
With a Taurus soul mission, having a strong sense of what's important
to YOU is the key to finding your soulmate. The more serenity you
discover within yourself, the more nurturing and peaceful your
relationship will be.
</p>

<p>
Strive for internal peace, rather than focusing on achieving peace and
balance in your relationships. This will actually improve your
relationships and bring you enormous fulfillment and satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
The house where your North Node in Taurus soul mission expresses
itself, is the area of life where new inner trust and security
replaces past struggles.
</p>

<p>
From http://www.pathwaytoascension.com/astrology/lesson7.html
</p>

<p>
You may be confronted with some of the most difficult karmic lessons
because the Plutonian force of Scorpio created many times of having
the rug pulled out from beneath you.  (Pluto rules Scorpio) As a
result of these soul memories, you may react defensively toward those
who offer regenerative advice.  In past lives, you suffered as you
reaped the results of false values.  You had to deal with a powerful
sex drive that sought gratification in a variety of relationships.
</p>

<p>
Now you are learning a new set of values by which to live.  You are
learning that sexual energy is also creative energy and how to
maintain a satisfying balance between the two.  You may still live
life on a largely unconscious level until you take charge and
deliberately choose to “know thyself” and learn to observe your
behavior so that you become aware of the reasons behind your words and
actions.  You will make much progress as you are able to view the
actions of others as reflections of your subconscious.
</p>

<p>
Observing yourself is important.  You may seek revenge in subtle ways
that end up with you appearing to be the victim, while in truth you
are the carefully planned victor.  Intense emotions need a variety of
creative outlets.  The lesson of forgiveness is paramount as you move
toward your NORTH MOON NODE IN TAURUS.  Taurus is the energy of
granting “love to the loveless” and “roots to the rootless.” (Alan
Oken) Taurus is the energy of supply, ruled by Venus.  As you
recognize the abundance within the Universe, you will always be
blessed with enough to meet all your needs.  Taurus leads you into a
garden of peace.
