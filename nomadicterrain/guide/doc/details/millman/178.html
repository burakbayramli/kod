<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These delightful and usually delighted individuals have bridged the worlds of
business and spirit, combining an abiding, transcendental trust in themselves
and in the world to direct them wherever they need to go. Trusting a higher
power than their own, these spirited innovators find their own power as well,
and they help empower and uplift others. They enjoy a sense of abundance that
flows forth, attracted by their uplifting energy. As this energy moves into the
world in service, and they use mind and money for higher purposes, whatever they
do in the name of Spirit comes back in the form of further blessings.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Insecure, withdrawn, and afraid of confrontation, these individuals feel baffled
by the world. They want recognition, fear betrayal, and feel that something is
missing -- the spiritual side of their life. Over controlling, they often feel
mistrust in business dealings, and they have unexpressed inner conflicts about
the morality of money. Pulled between inner and outer drives, they have a hard
time being on the planet, in the sense of knowing what to do here. Although they
may seem outgoing, they don't really share themselves or their very private
inner processes. With the mental qualities of 7s and the power issues of 8s,
they inadvertently talk over people's heads or sound preachy. They lack faith in
the powers of self or Spirit.
