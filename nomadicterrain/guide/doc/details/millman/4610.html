<h3>46/10</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals have distinctive qualities of strength, sensitivity, vision,
and a bright, clear field of energy. They have the intuitive capacity to create
a vision or internal ideal, along with the strength to work as long as it takes
to help bring that vision into reality. Pioneers who point the way, they meet
with success in business and in relationships by accepting people as they are
while skillfully moving to uplift and reach out even farther and higher. These
46/10s are literally or figuratively visionary warrior-priests, working for
higher justice.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Impatient, frustrated, insecure and discouraged because life never meets their
expectations or time tables, these individuals want heaven on Earth, right now,
but they don't appreciate the work required to bring it forth; like Don Quixote
tilting at windmills, they seek the "impossible dream." Sensitive to criticism
because they criticize themselves endlessly without realizing it, they don't
really hear others' feedback or advice; instead, they create rationalizations
that fool even themselves. Their judgments interfere with their direct intuitive
sight. Focusing only on problems, they discharge frustrated creative energy
through abusing alcohol, other drugs, food, or sex.
