<h3>30/3</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals bring enthusiasm, compassion, understanding, and service into
the world, in ways large or small, through their creative expression. Whatever
their occupation, when they speak, they do so with attunement and sensitivity,
and they uplift others. They are enthusiastic and connected to their emotions,
and their expressiveness is passionate, forthright, and even inspired. They are
honest in communicating their needs and feelings, neither manipulating nor
allowing themselves to be manipulated. They manage their lives responsibly, not
letting their own or other people's emotions run them. They use their inner
gifts of expression, sensitivity, and intuition in the service of others, with a
joy and altruism that further amplifies these resources, putting 30/3s in touch
with the subtle aspects and mystery of existence.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Depressed about the love they feel they lack from others, these individuals
complain about the wrongs of society and of their life, feeling justified
because there's much to criticize in this world. Needy and hypersensitive, they
whine or manipulate instead of stating honestly and directly what they need, who
they are, and how they feel. Some are completely blocked in their sexual
natures, while others have trouble with emotional or sexual fidelity and often
get into promiscuous situations.
