<h3>The Nine-Year Cycle</h3>

<p>
  Cycles are calculated according to the birth day, month and today's year. The
  cycle year reported is the position you are at in your 9 year cycle. All
  positions in the cycle are described below.
</p>

<p>
1: Creativity and Confidence The first year of a cycle is the year of
creativity, of planting the seeds, of newness, of opening to new opportunity
with confidence. The sprout is sown, but it hasn't yet broken through the
ground. This may involve a time of planning as well as planting, of resolutions
as well as map making. It can also mean going back to school, retraining, or
moving to a new location - beginning something anew. The snow is just melting in
early spring.
</p>

<p>
2: Cooperation and Balance The second year, the seed needs the help and
interaction of others - the sun, soil, and water. In our life, the second year
of the cycle means working with other people in some form, finding our
boundaries, defining ourselves in our new course of work or activity in terms of
our relationships with others. We form new ties, alliances, and support
networks. The earth grows warmer.
</p>

<p>
3: Expression and Sensitivity The third year, the seed breaks through the soil
into the sunlight; this may mean a time of visibility and careful growth. The
shoot is still green and vulnerable. This time may bring a feeling of
vulnerability; doubts may arise: "Can I do it?" Our horizons grow wider; we
see and experience more. It's now late spring.
</p>

<p>
4: Stability and Process The fourth year, the shoot grows thicker and stronger,
extending its roots deeper into the soil. This is time to establish stability; a
critical stage, a time not for show but for making sure our roots are
strong. This is a time to review and reflect, a time to catch up on anything
overlooked, a time to regroup our forces and make sure our preparations are
complete. Summer is around the corner.
</p>

<p>
5: Freedom and Discipline The fifth year in the cycle, the tree begins to
blossom and attract other life - birds, bees, and forest creatures. Just so, if
our work has been sound and the soil rich, if we have made good use of the first
four years through our labours, now is the time of opportunity, of many options
and choices. The orchard bears its first fruit. This is a time of
celebration. Summer is here.
</p>

<p>

6: Vision and Acceptance The sixth year if a time to give back, to share the
harvest with all those who would eat from the fruit of the tree, to pour out,
with a sense of duty and high vision, sharing our good fortune. It is a time of
generosity and abundance, but also a time to accept and to appreciate the bigger
picture of what has been, what is to become, and what lies beyond. It's late
summer.
</p>

<p>
7: Trust and Openness The seventh year is a time for gratitude in remembering
the Source of all the fruit of all the trees. Not as goal oriented, it is a time
for enjoyment and ease, a time to look back and learn from the years that have
come before: the first year's creative impulse, the second year's teamwork and
cooperation, the third year's vulnerability and doubt overcome, the fourth
year's regrouping and consolidation, the fifth year's harvest, and the sixth
year's sharing. To this, is now added the gratitude for it all, seeing how all
prior challenges contributed to the present moment. Autumn has come.
</p>

<p>
8: Abundance and Power The eighth year brings, for those with the willingness
and command to reap the harvest, abundant rewards for the previous seven
years. The harvest directly reflects the quality of all that came before. The
tree now stands tall and strong, mature and valued, ready to harvest. Autumn
leaves shower like gold, like rainbows, as the winds of change begin to blow,
signalling the later days of autumn.
</p>

<p>

9: Integrity and Wisdom This ninth year is a year of completion, of letting go,
of quiet reflection that leads to wisdom - a time of looking backward and
understanding that all cycles end; then begin again. Attachment never avails
here, for all things pass; the fall has ended, and now is the time for plowing
under, turning the soil, so that next spring cycle we can plant anew, with
renewed hope and vigour, improving on this cycle through the wisdom
gained. Winter's bittersweet presence brings a period of inner silence, and
stillness, as we wait for the light to come again.
