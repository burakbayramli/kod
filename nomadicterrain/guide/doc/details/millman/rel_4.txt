4: Stability and Process

Positive Aspects and Issues

The 4 relationship serves as a strong foundation for a family or a
business enterprise. Each person contributes to a sense of
security. Each gives the other honest feedback to clarify and help
ensure the success of mutual goals. Whether or not the people are
actually related, a sense of "family" pervades.

Negative Aspects and Issues

The 4 relationship can suffer from burdens of responsibility or
obligation and may entail arguments about family or
relatives. Unrealistic ambitions and confused plans may produce
stress, frustration, or failure. A feeling of stubbornness,
conflicting ambitions, or instability pervades.
