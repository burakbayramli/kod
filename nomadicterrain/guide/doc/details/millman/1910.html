<h3>19/10</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals have a magnetic personality that attracts others. They use
their intuitive wisdom in counseling, healing, problem solving, or other forms
of creative endeavor. Having made peace with themselves, they offer guidance by
example rather than dogmatic opinions, and they respect others' opinions without
being dependent on them. They have found the confidence to reveal their
sensitive natures, resulting in fulfilling relationships. These individuals
enjoy regular exercise as a means of balancing their energies, and they have
avoided or overcome destructive addictions. They energize, influence, and
inspire those around them.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
When the energies of 19/10s are bound or held in, they create physical
discomfort, tension, and pent-up, explosive anger, as well as problems with
tobacco, alcohol, other drugs, or food. Rigidly opinionated, these individuals
zealously identify with causes, beliefs, or philosophies. Such 19/10s are
usually unmarried, divorced, or just difficult to live with. They alternate
between acting shy and bossy, opinionated and insecure. When inhibited, they
repress sexual energy; when frustrated, they exploit or abuse sexuality. Their
dogmatic opinions reflect their underlying insecurity.
