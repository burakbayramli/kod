<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Brilliant at structuring and synthesizing, these individuals can use razor-sharp
analysis to determine what they need and then follow the steps necessary to
achieve their goal. They maintain a balanced body through regular exercise and
disciplined diet. Their highly visual imagination, brimming with creativity, is
supported by an ability to follow patiently whatever process is necessary to
bring their internal images into practical reality. Strong and inspiring, they
display a broad grasp of many areas of life, and their outgoing nature makes
them enjoyable company.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Hampered by confusion and insecurity, these individuals accomplish little; they
get stuck obsessively on one step, or they impulsively drive ahead, skipping
steps, so it's halfway to the goal, then back to the drawing board. They feel
torn between their desire for security and their need to take risks and explore
the unknown. Uncommitted and unstable, they want freedom right now, without
applying the discipline or following the step-by-step process to get it. Without
a foundation to stand on, they waver and wobble, hoping and wishing, doing many
things, but without real effect.
