5: Freedom and Discipline

Positive Aspects and Issues

The 5 relationship can open doors to a sense of adventure, even in the
midst of daily life, bringing new experience and mutual
interdependence that only draws the relationship c1oser. There are no
assumed limits, and both people experience the freedom to be
themselves.

Negative Aspects and Issues

The 5 relationship can suffer from inner conflict and scattered goals,
from a pull between dependence and a desire for independence, from
underconfidence, from a feeling of going in different directions or in
too many directions at once, or from a sense of being trapped. 

Questions

What priorities and disciplines are most important to both of us?
When we want new adventure, who really stops us?  How can we help each
other feel a sense of inner freedom?
