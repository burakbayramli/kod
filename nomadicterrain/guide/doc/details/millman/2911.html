<h3>29/11</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These people feel inspired and inspire others as they follow a clear path of
service, the underlying motive in all that they do. Creative strategists,
supportive friends, and loyal allies, they attract people with their natural
charisma and lead by inspiration. In whatever creative field they choose, they
offer something special, showing exceptional vitality and endurance to reach
their goals. Relaxed and open, these 29/11s get inspiration directly from
Spirit.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Outwardly insecure and inhibited, or aloof, subdued, and seemingly self-assured,
these individuals feel haunted by a sense of inferiority that manifests as
competitiveness and a fear of losing. Dominant and opinionated, they seem to
have a chip on their shoulder and a need to prove something. Stubborn and
resistant, bossy and highly opinionated, they have a hard time letting go. Their
illusory inferiority inhibits creative risks that would make their life
exciting. Lost, without a real sense of themselves, they alternate between bouts
of fitful energy and periods of collapse. Their pent-up energy generates
addictive or abusive behaviors, and their lessons about spiritual law
(especially about actions and their consequences) often get delivered in a court
of law.
