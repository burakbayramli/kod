<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals have achieved a sense of inner abundance and power through
inner discipline, and many blessings have appeared in their life -- blessings of
abundance they share generously and wisely through their high intelligence and
expressive abilities. Others view them as powerful leaders due to their powerful
mind, their ability to see the bigger picture, and their genius at getting
things done. Emotionally open and vulnerable, they know when to stand their
ground and when to let go. These self-made people have a generous, philanthropic
nature, taking on positions of leadership and authority. Their relationships are
open and mutually supportive.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
People fear these individuals without knowing why. Their drive for success,
along with dependent feelings and self-doubt, lead them to a tendency toward
opportunism as they seek to obtain from others the power and support they
haven't found within. They tend to express and control indirectly, through
manipulation. They desire wealth and power, but they lack the necessary focus or
discipline and tend to sabotage their own efforts because of their inner
conflicts. Feeling bad about themselves and powerless and frustrated over their
circumstances, they have difficulties with lasting relationships, which
degenerate into struggles for control or alternate between aggressive
independence and extreme dependence and neediness.
