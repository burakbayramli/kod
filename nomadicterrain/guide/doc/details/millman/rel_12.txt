12: Creative Cooperation

Positive Aspects and Issues

The 12 relationship means a productive team wherein each contributes
to an interdependent whole. Here we have complementary energies,
sharing, and selfless contributions focused on the oneness of
partnershipâ€”on what's right, not who's right. The 12 could be added
again (1 + 2) for a sum of 3, so full and honest emotional expression
is key here.

Negative Aspects and Issues

The 12 relationship can suffer from egoic conflict and blocked
creativity. "United we stand or divided we fall" applies here;
divided, these individuals see only strife and frustration, each self
holding on to its own bottled energy. Self-expression is stifled, like
a powerful train stuck at the station.

Key Questions

What can we each do to support the other?

When do we do the best work together?

How do we find a balance between giving too much and giving too little?
