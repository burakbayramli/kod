<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals have developed a sound financial base as well as a
personal base of family, friends, and associates. They make decisions
by blending head (analysis) and heart (intuition), and they have
learned to trust the process of their life. Well-rounded achievers,
they have followed goals to completion as they have learned skills,
and they use that understanding to reach any goal. Dependable and
stable, they have the blend of strength, flexibility, sensitivity, and
creative sparkle that serves as a source of practical support and
encouragement to others.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Even if they have a place to live, these individuals lack an inner
sense of stability; it's as if they were living out of a
suitcase. Uncommitted and lacking follow-through, they never feel sure
how long they'll stay in one place, in one job, or with one
person. Ambitious but impatient, they touch down many places, but they
don't put down roots. Confusion underlies their lack of commitment;
they don't feel sure of what they're "supposed" to be doing. They
think one thing and feel another, so they don't know what they
want. This split between mind and emotions leads to impulsive
decisions and then obsessive regrets. They experience more starts and
stops than completions. With their unrealistic expectations, they want
to be a success without going through the process to get there. Their
outward bravado or superior air covers up feelings of self-doubt and
insecurity.
