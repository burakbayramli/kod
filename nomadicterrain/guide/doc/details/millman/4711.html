<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
The energy field of these individuals shines with a kind of clear luminosity
others sense rather than see with their physical eyes. By their inspiring
presence, they remind us of the creative energy and Spirit that works through
all of us, whether or not we are yet aware of it. Traveling through different
dimensions in imagination, they experience life as a spiritual mystery -- a
living, tacit realization -- and they use their analytical skills,
lightning-fast mind, and creative energy to share this uplifted experience of
life with others. It may be hard for us to fathom the source of their
inspiration or to keep up with their pace. It's as if they have an angel on
their shoulder; the more they trust and work with their inner guides and subtle
intuitions, the more positive energy and beauty they bring into the world.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals live in a world of their own mind, without a sense of
grounding or connection. Isolated and embittered, they lose themselves in the
"virtual reality" of their creative imagination and live like hermits, even when
among people. They prefer computers to people, and solitude to people they
mistrust. Brilliant failures, they want a magical world where things happen
quickly and easily, and they don't always want to be here on planet Earth. They
are very sensitive to feeling betrayed by others, and they experience
conflicting pulls between inner and outer reality. Struggling under the weight
of unresolved childhood difficulties, with their emotions inhibited, they are
vulnerable to addiction to escapist drugs or experiences.
