<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals have a natural depth, charisma, and magnetism. They have an
outgoing, charismatic personality that reflects both intelligence and broader
wisdom. Their work at home, in their community, or in the world at large
reflects their natural leadership by example. Brilliant strategists who know and
follow the rules of any game they play, they use their influence and share their
abundance to make a difference beyond themselves. With their spiritual power
made manifest, they lead by example and by inspiration and provide valuable
ideas to others. Life is never boring around them. Hardworking and creative,
they subordinate their work to a higher good.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Although their outer world may look good from the viewpoint of others, the inner
world of these individuals is filled with turmoil, suppressed fear, and a sense
of heaviness, laden with the idea of sin and salvation. They long for health and
inner peace, but they get caught up in their own opinions and tend to seek
absolute power and control. They preach to others, overtly or subtly, about how
life should be lived, but they do not follow their own dictates. They resist
what arises in their own life and want to control the lives of others. They lose
sight of the larger gifts contained in their own challenges.
