<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
With their high standards and vision, these individuals make good money, doing
what they enjoy, serving other people. They feel a sense of balanced inner power
in their relationships, their work, and their life. Out of a sense of expansive
abundance, they can hold on or let go as appropriate, without the need to
manipulate or control others. They maintain their sense of fairness and
integrity and serve as a positive and uplifting influence in the world, using
their power and position to help others, perhaps through philanthropy. They hold
money and recognition in perspective, focusing on their higher purpose.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These unassertive individuals feel timid, invisible, and ignored. Deeply
frustrated in their own endeavors, they resent "rich people" due to their own
negative beliefs about money. They find it difficult to get along with others or
to form relationships, and they get into power struggles unless the lines of
authority are clearly defined. Over-controlling perfectionists, they are
critical of others, especially those who don't show them respect. They
undervalue themselves and their work, judging themselves against unrealistically
high standards, and they refrain from taking on challenges in the material
world. They not only avoid the fast lane, they don't even get on the highway.
