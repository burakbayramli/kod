9: Integrity and Wisdom

Positive Aspects and Issues

The 9 relationship is founded upon or develops a deep connection
through compassion and tolerance; these individuals are together to
teach each other about integrity and life through their differences;
this provides a rare opportunity for inner growth and mutual tolerance
by respecting each other's differences.

Negative Aspects and Issues

The 9 relationship can entail a lonely, cut-off feeling, a sense of
disconnection of the two people from each other, and even from
themselves. The two may experience a "can't live with, can't live
without" feeling about the other person. Strong opinions clash because
these two people see life very differently.

Key Questions

Do we impose our opinions on each other?

How do we honor and appreciate our differences?

Do we remember that each of us knows at some level what is best for
ourselves, but not necessarily what is best for the other?
