<h3>40/4</h3>

<p>
<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals prepare thoroughly for any task, and they patiently follow a
step-by-step process to reach their goals. They can be counted on to follow
through with any commitment, and others perceive them as stable and trustworthy
friends and advisers. When making decisions, they consider and analyze their
options and also trust their gut feelings. They have worked out any family
issues to create the best relationship with parents that is feasible. These
40/4s display exceptional fortitude, but they also make use of their subtle
gifts and intuition. They persist through hardships and obstacles, no matter how
long it takes, and they remain flexible if they reach an impasse. They have
created a stable home situation. Relying on intuition and faith, they eventually
find the situations and opportunities to suit their interests and abilities.</p>

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals don't trust their intuition, and thus they find decision
making a stressful, confusing exercise. Stuck in the mind's never-ending
analyses, they go in circles trying to answer questions such as "How can I make
things happen?" They end up making impulsive decisions they later regret. Their
relationships tend to be unstable and short-lived. They have trouble with
commitment or staying put with anyone or anything for very long, so they repeat
the same patterns of hello-goodbye. Their stubbornness and unyielding views get
in the way of the compromise inherent in any relationship. Impulsive and
self-deceiving, they tend to start and stop a task without completing it.
