h11: Double Creativity and Confidence

Positive Aspects and Issues

The 11 relationship produces passionate sparks of creative energy
that, when channeled, generate special magnetism (sexual or
otherwise); these people can create anything together. They're like
oxygen and fire. The 11 could be added again (1 +1) for a sum of 2, so
cooperation is essential here.

Negative Aspects and Issues

The 11 relationship may suffer from blocked or misdirected creative
energy that can explode as shared addictions or physical violence. The
partners experience a classic love-hate relationship marked by high
insecurity and intense sexual chemistry. This energy is rarely boring.

Key Questions

What makes me feel excited about this relationship?

When we argue, how could we turn the same energy into love?

How do we utilize or inhibit our mutual energy?
