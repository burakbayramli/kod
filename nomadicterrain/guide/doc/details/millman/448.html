<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
With the fortitude, perseverance, and analytical skills to take the necessary
steps from where they are to where they want to go, no goal is beyond the reach
of these individuals. Their mind approaches any task as a series of component
parts, breaking down big goals into small steps. Their health and vitality are
exceptional; they take good care of themselves and show necessary caution and
care. Loyal and dependable, they form stable and lasting relationships, and they
enjoy a sense of family and community with society at large. Powerful and
practical, with commonsense business acumen and a drive for success, they allow
their strength, their ability to follow a process, and their flexibility to take
them to a life of abundance, not just for themselves, but for a larger cause.

<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals usually manage to maintain control, but they tend to be on the
hysterical side. Confused and stressed, when they reach the end of their rope,
they may "let go" in the form of nervous breakdowns. With their stubborn, blind
faith in themselves, they seem to repeat the same mistakes again and
again. Their relationships are a source of pain and frustration because they
constantly engage in power struggles and arguments. They may have made a lot of
money and then lost it; they search for a sense of stability but cannot make a
commitment to anything or anyone. They desire success without being willing to
take the steps to achieve it. They feel responsible for too much, yet they try
to avoid responsibility for fear they'll fail.
