<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
The many fine qualities these individuals possess are magnified through their
interaction and collaboration with others. They bring passion, presence, and
expressive creativity into the world. They respect others' opinions as well as
their own. They know when to hold their ground and when to stay flexible. They
make loyal friends, and their relationships are based on heartfelt feeling and
deep understanding and respect. They find meaning and enjoyment in their work,
which makes use of their creativity and expression, as they help others do their
best. These individuals show class and refinement, strength and sensitivity.

<p>
<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Stubborn and insecure, these individuals create in the negative through
complaints and cutting remarks that reflect the depth of overwhelming passions
for which they can find no outlet. They overgive, then find fault and
withdraw. They have trouble getting along, even with themselves, as their drives
compete for priority and attention and their mind whirls as they try to decide
what they should do and for whom. They feel as if they're living for other
people, at the whim of others' needs and opinions. They have unusual,
emotionally generated physical ailments stemming from frustrated
expression. They feel lonely and isolated.
