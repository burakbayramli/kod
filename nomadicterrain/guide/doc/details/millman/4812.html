<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals will learn the lessons of process through their experience:
"When in a hurry, slow down;" and "Better to do it right than do it over." In
working through their own family issues, they will develop compassion and
understanding. Creative troubleshooters, they will find the self-control, the
integrated talents, and the drives to support the common good effectively and
powerfully. Through creative service, they will find the recognition they
desire. Happiest where the action is, in the center of the cyclone, they will
serve where they can, in the way that gives them the most joy, often as pioneers
of new frontiers.

<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Caught in a maelstrom of change like a rigid tree in a high wind, these
individuals will fight to maintain control in a world that feels out of control,
reflecting their inner turbulence and frustrated ambition. Their creative energy
will demand release, but they will withhold it, afraid of what it might do. They
will bend over backward to help other people and then resent it. Stalinlike,
they may end up "helping by command," even in their own family. They will resent
others' authority until they find the courage to apply their own. Ambitious,
they will want everything now, but they won't understand the time or effort it
takes to achieve goals and so will end up brilliant failures. When they
compromise their integrity, they will meet with short-term rewards but court
long-term disaster. When they fall, they will fall hard.
