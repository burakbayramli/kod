<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
Feeling free inside, unbounded by limiting beliefs or fears, these multifaceted
individuals are willing to take emotional risks. "Adventurers in daily life,"
they may or may not choose to go white-water rafting or skydiving, but they have
developed the discipline to dig deeply into life, into the heart of experience,
rather than just skim the surface. Passionate and adventurous, like Zorba the
Greek, they teach by example and excitement. With their quick minds, they see
and describe life in new ways. They have formed good habits and enjoy variety
within a daily routine. Clever, witty, and fun loving, they make the ordinary
into something extraordinary.

<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
Feeling insecure, these individuals manipulate and control others, usually by
getting angry or by withdrawing. Or they try too hard to please others and later
resent others for their own imbalance. They unintentionally create situations in
which they become dependent on someone or something, such as drugs or
money. They give away their freedom or limit their experience out of fear and
self-doubt. Scattered and quickly bored, they are emotional con artists. Lacking
clear boundaries, they play different roles or experience different selves
through television or books. Addicted to dramas of one kind or another, they
remain at the mercy of their search for varied experience.
