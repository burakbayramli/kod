8: Abundance and Power

Positive Aspects and Issues

The 8 relationship can reflect benign give-and-take, where power is
freely given and shared for mutual benefit, generating a sense and
reality of abundance. Here, mental harmony opens the way for love
without strings attached.

Negative Aspects and Issues

The 8 relationship can suffer from control or authority issues, such
as struggles about who is in charge, leading to a battle of
wills. Money may feel scarce. There may be too much desire to get
without giving or doing what's necessary; opportunism may undermine a
true sense of relationship.

Key Questions

What can we give to each other?
Does either of us feel the need to control the other? If so, why?
How can we together experience a sense of abundance?
