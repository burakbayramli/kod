<b>In the Positive</b>
</p>

<p>
These clear-thinking, centered individuals can accomplish whatever they set out
to do, by a process of small steps, turning stumbling blocks along the way into
stepping-stones. When they fail, they learn from their mistakes and do not
repeat them. They have learned hard lessons, but over time the lessons have
gotten easier. They have found the balance point between giving too much and
giving too little. They live from a stable center of internal harmony and
cooperation. They serve others only to the point they feel good and clear about
their service. Relatively free of worry and stress, they allow their body to
relax into life; their mind focuses on the present as they plan the next small
step along the way.

<b>In the Negative</b>
</p>

<p>
These individuals always seem to verge on the edge of one crisis or
another. They are frequently frantic, even hysterical. They experience inner
confusion and stress. Making impulsive decisions they later regret, they
stubbornly hold their course and repeat the same mistakes. Their forceful, rigid
views create anger when others don't do what these individuals think they
should. As master codependents, they over give to the point of depletion. They
form intense relationships, which they throw themselves into at first and then
cut themselves off from, feeling alienated and resentful. Generally impatient,
they want to get everything done now, without going through the necessary
step-by-step process.
