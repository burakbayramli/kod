Cycle is the period your life path is on; according to his method life
proceeds in 9 year cycles, 1 is time to start something 9 to enjoy its
fruits (and not start something new).

Here is a related interesting exercise; starting from the cycle you
are at today, go back in time, year by year; i.e. if current cycle
point says 4, and the current year is 2015,

```
2010 8
2011 9
2012 1
2013 2
2014 3
2015 4
...
```

and try to remember the state of your life at those moments in
time, especially at year 1. The results can be revealing.
