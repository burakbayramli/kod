You have an underlying self-confidence that is based on your belief that life
will give you whatever you want if you are willing to work for it. You see the
reasonableness in the way that things happen and are willing to invest in
yourself. You are very industrious, believing that hard work will bring you
progress. You have a taste for material acquisition but are willing to work for
what comes to you. 

<br/><br/>

Jupiter trine Saturn: *You have a good balance between idealism, optimism, and
vision for the future on one hand and a realistic sense of what can actually be
achieved on the other hand. Your judgment and business sense are usually quite
good. You possess patience and the ability to accept limitation and frustration
on the way to your goals.

<br/><br/>

Older, more experienced individuals or mentors are likely to play a significant
and beneficial role in your life.

<br/><br/>

Jupiter sextile Saturn: *You have the patience and the stamina to realize your
visions and bring them down to earth, a fine balance between hard work and
realism, and a positive, hopeful spirit. You grow through following systems and
plans, and taking one step at a time. Overnight success or instant enlightenment
is not what you aim for. Your patient, well-balanced approach gives you
credibility with many different types of people, and you are apt to gain an
excellent reputation for being able to do big things without overreaching or
becoming pretentious.

<br/><br/>

You have the capacity to endure through the daily grind to find something of
spiritual value in your work and relationships. You are happy to spend time in
seclusion, studying or meditating.
