You have a tendency to impose your will upon others, which can cause severe
problems for yourself when they react in self-defense. You have a hair-trigger
temper and may even resort to verbal or physical abuse when upset. Learning to
react to unpleasant circumstances with your intellect rather than your emotions
comes with maturity.

<br/><br/>

It is all too easy for you to find something negative about a situation. Avoid
issuing ultimatums when you meet an obstacle. Instead, find a way to convince
others to work with you of their own free will. Ordinary life often seems drab
and uninteresting to you and you must have something that stirs your
imagination, some vision or ideal or dream to motivate you. You have a strong
urge to act out your fantasies or to live your dream, and you will DO things
that others only talk about or dream about. Artistic creation, drama, or other
areas in which you can express yourself imaginatively are excellent for you.

<br/><br/>

You do not easily tolerate a dominating attitude in others. You have a healthy
respect for power and authority, but only if it is handled fairly.

<br/><br/>

This aspect gives you a somewhat Scorpionic attitude toward your lovers, and it
can modify the traits associated with the sign of your Mars considerably. In
other words, there is a distinct possessive and demanding streak in your sexual
nature. Your approach to love and sex can be quite intense at times. Your sexual
desire nature is a very strong one, and you may even use sex as a bargaining
chip in your relationships in order to achieve your goals. More likely, however,
is a very focused and intense sexual nature. This also adds a very magnetic
quality to your appeal. When a woman finds you attractive, it can transform into
a near obsession! Your aura is strong and somewhat mysterious. You tend to come
across as stronger than you intend. In fact, some people are intimidated by you,
and you may not understand why this is so. When you want something (or someone!)
you are very determined. For you, it can be "all or nothing". When you are
finished with something, you leave it behind you and there is no going back. You
want a deep, soulful attachment on a sexual level. In your love life you do not
take rejection well. You fear betrayal and abandonment, and this can skew your
perception of your lover. You have a highly developed sex drive, but you must
learn to rein in your aggressiveness in this area. Power struggles and control
issues may surface often in your relationships. You perceive the cruel edge in
people, and understand its source. Self-confidence develops out of self-control
in your interaction with others. -- Interpretation from our LoveStyles: About

<br/><br/>

Work that serves only your own narrow personal interests does not satisfy
you. You may lack the competitive edge, the fighting spirit, the me-first
attitude that is often required for material advancement and success. You also
tend to either overestimate or underestimate your own power and abilities.

<br/><br/>

You perceive the cruel edge in people, and understand its source. As you deal
with your own ruthlessness, you learn how to respond to it in others without
risking your physical well-being. Self-confidence develops out of self-control
in your interaction with others.
