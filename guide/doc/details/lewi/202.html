On a personal level, these people hold back free expression of their feelings,
especially with regard to expressions of love. Mind you, they are masters of
compromise, duty, and responsibility to their mates, and it is through this
dedication that they do in fact express their love. Often, there is some form of
deprivation in the childhood, associated with either mother or father, or
both. Most commonly, the child absorbs something from the parents' relationship
that results in a deep sense of obligation towards the mate and emotional
reserve. Fear of letting go, enjoying the moment, and expressing love openly is
strong. Although this aspect in classical astrology is associated with a delayed
marriage or loneliness, I see it much more frequently in the charts of people
who do indeed "partner", often early, and who stick to the relationship through
thick and thin. Often, they are lonely even though they are partnered. Commonly
as well, they bend to a demanding partner much of their lives. There is fear
associated with love, and many people with this position struggle with a lack of
confidence. One of their greatest fears is rejection. Another reason why they
might remain loyal to a challenging marriage can be a fear of letting down
family and of what he or she feels would be a blow to the reputation. Sometimes,
material concerns are connected with relationships. Some stick to relationships
because they give them a sense of material security. Self-sacrifice is extremely
common with this position. However, even though they crave more than anything to
be loved unconditionally, their conviction that they won't get that kind of love
keeps them from really trying to find it. With Saturn, there is a simultaneous
fear of failure and fear of success that keeps people from feeling free or brave
enough to go after what they truly want.

<br/><br/>

There can be a somewhat detached manner, and many people with this aspect
(especially men) can come across as skeptical, matter-of-fact, and even
superficial on a social level. They are masters at protecting their feelings,
and do whatever they can to avoid letting others know of their
vulnerabilities. Of course, this kind of defense mechanism further prevents them
from finding happiness in love. It is so very hard for them to let down their
defenses. They'll need to really know where they stand with you before they can
feel at least somewhat safe. Negative expectations in love must be handled in
order to begin work on handling this aspect. The good news with Saturn is that
its energy is handled better with time and maturity. These people should make a
conscious effort to evaluate their behavior. If they admit to themselves that
they do in fact want and need to be loved by a partner, they can work on slowly
dropping their defenses. For example, keeping loved ones at arm's length and
pretending that you are just fine on your own isn't going to encourage
intimacy. Jumping to negative conclusions or withdrawing emotionally when an
expression of warmth is not received exactly as you intended is not going to
help either. It's also a good idea to examine the choice of partners. There can
be an unconscious attraction to people who love you for all the wrong
reasons--for superficial or material reasons. Maintaining "business-like" love
relationships somehow keeps people with these aspects feeling safe, but they
unfortunately perpetuate a deep feeling of loneliness and unworthiness.

With the conjunction, and especially with supporting aspects from other planets,
these people have every opportunity to advance in their chosen career. Business
sense is strong, especially in the areas of finance and the arts. Commitment,
whether to a pet project, a job, a business, or a person, is characteristic.

<br/><br/>

Intimacy does not come easily to you and you may appear cold or
unfeeling to others due to your emotional reserve and caution. Perhaps
due to painful relationships and separations in your early life, you
do not trust others very easily and it takes a long time to take down
all of your barriers and defenses. You may feel that you have few
friends or people that really care about you. You need to learn to
value and love yourself more and to express your appreciation for
others more openly.

<br/><br/>

You are reserved. You don't jump into a spiritual practice any more than you
jump into a love relationship. You may do best with a spiritual teacher who is
much older or younger than yourself. You accept endings as a necessary part of
life.
