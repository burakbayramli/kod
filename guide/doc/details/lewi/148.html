Generosity of spirit is most evident when Moon conjuncts Jupiter in the natal
chart. These people are ready to laugh, quick to forgive, and
warm-hearted. Jupiter aligned with the Moon offers perspective to the emotions,
so that the natives are able to reason themselves out of depression, foul moods,
and the like. This perspective allows the natives to understand others unusually
well. They are hospitable, kind, and forgiving. Sometimes quite opinionated,
however, these people possess a strong sense of right and wrong. They can be
quite impassioned about what is fair, what isn't fair, and what everyone should
do about it! When someone is down, they are the first people to jump in with
support and advice. Not everyone wants to deal with their emotions in such a
rational manner, however, so Moon conjunct Jupiter people can sometimes support
people in a way that is not always appreciated, but their kind-hearted approach
is generally well-received.

These people have a sense of humor that makes them a joy to be around. They are
also very intuitive. Their hunches and premonitions are often right on
target. As such, they can have a reputation for being quite "lucky". It's not
necessarily psychism that is at the root of this, however. It is more about an
expansive understanding of human nature and the world around them. These are
very generous people who respond in big ways to others, sometimes overdoing it
to the point that they try to please everyone around them. It is interesting
that these people who are so very charitable and forgiving can sometimes come
across as a bit preachy. The reason behind it is that their emotional natures
(Moon) work hand-in-hand with their higher minds (Jupiter). Jupiter is very
grand and good-spirited, but it is also a planet that rules the concept of right
and wrong. These people make excellent teachers and they are often interesting
story-tellers. There is a strong attachment to the past, to history, and to
cultures of the world.

You are tolerant and forgiving, always ready to overlook mistakes and
give others a second chance. You expect the best from people and draw
it out of them, and you enjoy making others comfortable and
happy. Because of your emotional generosity, your life is rich with
friends, and often financial blessings as well.
