When Moon is in hard aspect to Saturn in the natal chart, natives need to learn
to trust others more. Fear keeps them from fully enjoying personal
relationships, and fear is behind the occasional rigidity that they
express. When they let themselves receive nurture or care from others, an inner
voice cautions them that it might not be sincere, long-lasting, or enough! There
can be some reluctance about becoming a parent, but once taken on, these people
don't take their responsibility lightly.

<br/><br/>

Emotional reticence is the main theme of these aspects. Many people with this
aspect had a lot of conditions placed on the love they received in early
childhood. They tend to expect the same later in life. With hard Saturn aspects,
individuals are often plagued with doubts, not only about the self but about
what to expect from life itself. The problem is that expecting difficulties or
negative situations creates an aura around them that perpetuates the
problem. They must work hard at positive thinking and expecting more from
life. Ironically, many people with hard Saturn aspects can be quite sarcastic,
skeptical, and rigid in manner. This is essentially a defense mechanism designed
to protect themselves from harshness in the world.

<br/><br/>

It is extremely likely that they feel neglected because they perceive it in the
first place, and later expect it, to be the case. There's a vicious circle going
on here that can only be broken when the patterns created by negative
conditioning are broken. Adjusting one's perceptions and expectations is the key
to breaking out of these negative patterns. Otherwise, natives of hard
Moon-Saturn aspects will live life feeling left out--attracting circumstances
that perpetuate a feeling of deep unhappiness and dissatisfaction.

<br/><br/>

Moon square Saturn and Moon opposition Saturn: You often feel that you
must do something or be something other than what you are in order to
receive approval and acceptance from others. You are very sensitive to
criticism and easily feel left out or neglected, and though you may
appear cool or distant, you actually care very much about being
included. Because you are so sensitive, it may seem easier for you to
withdraw into a shell rather than risk the emotional bumps and bruises
that can occur when you let others really know you in an intimate,
personal way. Your reserve and caution make establishing a close
emotional rapport with others difficult for you, and you become very
attached to the few people you consider "real friends". You can gain
inner security and strength through periods of solitude if you view
them as times to nourish yourself and develop your own interests,
rather than as times of loneliness.
