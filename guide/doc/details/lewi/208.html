<p>
The ability to get along with--and accept--people from all walks of life as
friends is strong with this position. These people can readily see through
insincerity in others. In relationships, tolerance is the most important
"ingredient" to these people. Their sexual preferences are somewhat
unconventional, and they won't be happy with a partner who tries to limit their
sexual expression. They are usually quite capable of maintaining relationships
that require a great deal of freedom and tolerance, such as long-distance
romances or set-ups in which partners are unable to see each other
consistently. Their style in love is somewhat free and breezy, and
noncommittal. They quite naturally accept the idea that their partner might need
some personal space and freedom.


<br/><br/>

Venus sextile Uranus or Venus trine Uranus: You are open and
progressive in your attitudes towards love and romance, and
spontaneous and free in your love-expression. You are always willing
to experiment and try anything new that your partner suggests, and you
enjoy being surprised. A relationship in which both you and your
partner have a good deal of freedom and independence will hold your
interest much more than a safe, predictable one.
