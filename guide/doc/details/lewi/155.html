These people are generally pleasantly composed, due to an inner sense of harmony
and emotional balance. They are optimistic--and realistically so, most of the
time--which contributes to their overall "luck". They are able to get a real
perspective on emotional matters that not only benefits their outlook, they are
able to offer support to others when needed. Broad-mindedness is a wonderful
characteristic. Quick to find humor in situations, these people are generally
warm and fun to be around. Deep down, they believe in the basic goodness of
people and of life in general, and this basic and natural attitude helps them to
attract positive circumstances and to make good connections. One of their best
qualities is tolerance. Usually, they don't take life too seriously in the sense
that they believe in having a bit of fun. Their hunches are more often than not
bang-on.

Moon sextile Jupiter or Moon trine Jupiter: You are easygoing,
agreeable, and tolerant, willing to overlook others' mistakes, forget
the past, and begin again on a positive note. You enjoy making others
comfortable and happy, and sometimes overdo your generosity. You often
feel that "everything will turn out all right no matter what I do",
and so become lazy and lackadaisical.
