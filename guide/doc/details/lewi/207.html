You feel a strong sense of responsibility to the ones you love, and this is so
natural to you that it is second nature. Generally, you exercise caution and
good judgment in your relationships with others, and you are understanding when
others are in need. You pride yourself on being responsible and trustworthy, and
you do whatever you can to compromise when necessary. Perhaps because of the
training of your youth, you are well-disciplined and can focus your efforts
quite effectively in order to achieve success. Even though you will climb your
way to the top of your own ladder, you will not hesitate to offer a hand up to
others you meet along the way. This quality is one of the main reasons for your
success--your sensitivity to the needs of others.  You are a good parent and
will be a benevolent disciplinarian. You expect your children to learn to
respect others and to be conscious of needs other than their own. Instead of
trying to mold them into being a carbon copy of yourself, you will encourage
your children to develop their own individuality.  In romantic matters, you do
not rush headlong into affairs of the heart. You check out each potential
partner carefully, assessing their good and bad qualities. Most importantly, you
require that the partnership contain mutual respect and loyalty. You feel more
comfortable in a stable, long-term relationship than in a series of "casual
flings." It is so natural to you that you are responsible and concerned about
the person you love that it completely surprises you when you encounter people
who are not the same way, or who take relationships lightly!

<br/><br/>

You have a knack for handling pressures, stresses, and challenges of
relationships - you take relationship problems in stride, knowing fully well
that they are part of life. You take the bad with the good. You can be like a
Rock of Gibraltar with a person you love. You tend to learn from the mistakes
you make in relationships, and you don't run away when a problem presents
itself. You know how to make something last, and your ideal partner appreciates
this fact. Loyalty, fidelity, and security are very important to you in
love. You are cautious about giving your heart away but true to the one who does
win your love. Your tastes are simple, even austere, and you do not appreciate
frivolity. You are interested in a person's character and inner qualities far
more than their appearance. Casual or superficial relationships don't interest
you at all, for love seems to get deeper and richer and more satisfying for you
with time. Your sense of duty makes you a stable factor in difficult
situations. Faithful completion of your duties brings spiritual contentment into
your life, and you take great pride in relationships that withstand the test of
time.
