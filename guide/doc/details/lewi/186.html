Saturn connected to a personal planet in hard aspect has a censoring effect on
the planet involved. With Mercury in hard aspect to Saturn, whatever the person
says and writes is self-censored to some degree. It's hard for these people to
pour out their emotions, no matter how emotional or needy they feel on the
inside. This is because they are always aware of what others might think of them
with what they say. They are not necessarily deliberate talkers or thinkers. In
other words, they don't always pick and choose their words carefully or speak
slowly. However, they are careful with what they reveal to others. They make
plenty of disclaimers, and often come across as negative or sarcastic without
intending to. These are people who review conversations they've had with others,
and who often kick themselves for saying something they didn't intend to, or for
not saying something witty. Saturn tends to have a hobbling effect, and when
it's attached to the planet of communication in hard aspect, there can be some
feelings of insecurity about how we speak and communicate in general. These
people tend to worry about what they've said and how they could have said it
better. Some older astrology texts suggest that there can be learning disorders
or "slowness" with this aspect, but this is rarely the case. In fact, many
people with this aspect are very strong academically. The flow of their
communication is blocked in some manner, however, and this is due to an
automatic "self-censoring" tendency. Self-consciousness and hypersensitivity is
experienced with regards to their intelligence and ability to get ideas across
to others, especially in youth. These people need plenty of positive feedback
from others in order to feel more confident and less "blocked".

If you have this aspect in your chart, recognize that you are most likely harder
on yourself about how you communicate than others are. Ask people close to you
for an objective point of view. Chances are, they find you to be astute,
intelligent, and an effective speaker or writer. We often tell our kids "don't
worry about what others think", but telling this to a person with a hard Saturn
aspects is not enough, nor is it realistic. They will worry. Instead, I have
found that the best way to handle difficult Saturn aspects is to get objective
feedback from others! Mercury-Saturn people don't accept compliments
whole-heartedly, yet they crave them and need them. Others around them tend to
stop complimenting them, feeling that they either don't need compliments or
don't want to hear them. Nothing can be further than the truth!

Mercury/Saturn aspects indicate intellectual discipline, a serious
outlook, good powers of concentration, and a knack for logical
reasoning. You don't take things for granted, and you generally need
empirical evidence to overcome your native skepticism. Not content
with superficial understanding, you prefer to study subjects in
depth. Some with this aspect prefer to work alone or in a quiet
setting. Mathematical ability and a knack for working with figures are
often present. Your work habits are careful, tenacious, methodical,
and industrious. You are probably quite organized, hard working, and
proficient at dealing with rules, regulations, fine points, and
details. Writers with this aspect are typically masters of grammar and
style. There is frequently great ambition, self-control, and a
willingness to labor hard and long to achieve your goals. Others view
you as honest, prudent, diligent, and cautious. This aspect is common
in the charts of teachers, military leaders, and politicians.

If this conjunction forms stressful aspects with other planets, it can indicate
lack of self-confidence, unwillingness to admit mistakes, and a proneness to
depression. Children may have problems learning and difficulties in school. You
may suffer hardships in your life that lead you to become cunning, bitter,
cynical, callous, narrow-minded, or hard-hearted toward others. Shyness or
social awkwardness is often present, and the tension associated with the aspect
commonly manifests as acid indigestion.  -- Interpretation from our Career

<br/><br/>

Your mind is serious and deep, and you will rarely offer an opinion on
any matter until you have thoroughly considered and studied it. You
have excellent powers of concentration and enjoy studying or thinking
deeply in solitude. You have an aptitude for research or doing mental
work which requires precise, organized thinking, attention to detail,
and a methodical approach. You are conservative and something of a
skeptic, and may be narrow-minded and closed to new ideas, especially
if there is no concrete proof or scientific verification of
them. Socially, you are rather reserved, uncommunicative, and
uncomfortable with light, frivolous conversation.
