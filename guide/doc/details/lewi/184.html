You have an enthusiastic, incisive and energetic mind. You are practical and
compulsive. You think quickly and draw your inferences from empirical
observation. Your life suffers at times by being too "me" oriented. You don't
give an opinion as much as assert a point of view. You are a fighter for a cause
whether or not there is a fight, or for that matter, a cause. Your mind is on
fire so you often express yourself with anger. You have a natural talent for
occupations involving change and physical movement. 

<br/><br/>

You have a sharp mind and a sharp tongue as well, and love a vigorous
discussion or debate. You express your thoughts in a clear, decisive,
convincing style. You dislike vagueness and fuzzy thinking, and are
quick to point out the discrepancies in another's argument. At times
you are verbally aggressive and abrasive to others, and you tend to
overstate your case or offend people by your unadorned frankness. You
can be an effective spokesperson, lawyer, or salesman. You have an
aptitude for writing as well, particularly criticism or satire. You
enjoy mental challenges and mental work.
