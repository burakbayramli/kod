Saturn connected to a personal planet in hard aspect has a censoring effect on
the planet involved. With Mercury in hard aspect to Saturn, whatever the person
says and writes is self-censored to some degree. It's hard for these people to
pour out their emotions, no matter how emotional or needy they feel on the
inside. This is because they are always aware of what others might think of them
with what they say. They are not necessarily deliberate talkers or thinkers. In
other words, they don't always pick and choose their words carefully or speak
slowly. However, they are careful with what they reveal to others. They make
plenty of disclaimers, and often come across as negative or sarcastic without
intending to. These are people who review conversations they've had with others,
and who often kick themselves for saying something they didn't intend to, or for
not saying something witty. Saturn tends to have a hobbling effect, and when
it's attached to the planet of communication in hard aspect, there can be some
feelings of insecurity about how we speak and communicate in general. These
people tend to worry about what they've said and how they could have said it
better. Some older astrology texts suggest that there can be learning disorders
or "slowness" with this aspect, but this is rarely the case. In fact, many
people with this aspect are very strong academically. The flow of their
communication is blocked in some manner, however, and this is due to an
automatic "self-censoring" tendency. Self-consciousness and hypersensitivity is
experienced with regards to their intelligence and ability to get ideas across
to others, especially in youth. These people need plenty of positive feedback
from others in order to feel more confident and less "blocked".

If you have this aspect in your chart, recognize that you are most likely harder
on yourself about how you communicate than others are. Ask people close to you
for an objective point of view. Chances are, they find you to be astute,
intelligent, and an effective speaker or writer. We often tell our kids "don't
worry about what others think", but telling this to a person with a hard Saturn
aspects is not enough, nor is it realistic. They will worry. Instead, I have
found that the best way to handle difficult Saturn aspects is to get objective
feedback from others! Mercury-Saturn people don't accept compliments
whole-heartedly, yet they crave them and need them. Others around them tend to
stop complimenting them, feeling that they either don't need compliments or
don't want to hear them. Nothing can be further than the truth!

<br/><br/>

Your intellectual capabilities are well developed, and you can accomplish
anything that you set your mind to. You are likely to possess academic "smarts"
and writing ability. In some ways you are a loner. This is likely because your
greatest feelings of security arise from a job well done. Be sure to exercise
caution in entering into contracts. Don't overlook the important details that
can boomerang against you later. It may be best to hire an attorney or other
advisor to help you with these tasks. You might find that you are the victim of
"red tape", mix-ups, and communication problems more than most.

<br/><br/>

You sometimes come across as more stern or harsh than you actually are! There is
likely to be a negative or sarcastic style to your speech that you may not
always be aware of, but that others pick up quickly. You will find that others
often misunderstand your intentions rather easily, or that you misrepresent
yourself unwittingly. You often kick yourself for saying (or, more often, not
saying) something after a conversation is over. -- Interpretation from our
LoveStyles Report.

<br/><br/>

You have an aptitude for solving difficult mental problems due to your
careful, methodical approach, attention to detail, and tenacity in
following a matter through to its conclusion. You have good powers of
concentration and enjoy studying and thinking in solitude. You can get
wrapped up entirely in your own thoughts and completely engrossed in
some small detail. You are slow and cautious, but extremely thorough
in your work. Conservative and something of a skeptic, you may be
narrow-minded or closed to any idea which has no concrete proof or
scientific verification. You prefer dealing with facts rather than
abstract speculation. You may also be distrustful or fearful of
anything you cannot understand with your rational mind. You are
well-suited to work in research or any field that requires careful
study and thought.
