<p>
These people are big-hearted and warm, with open hearts and a tendency to want
to give a lot to the people they love. They can have some problems with
following through on their promises, however--not because of any ill intent, but
because they sometimes overestimate their personal capabilities, and want to do
more, and give more, than is actually possible. At distinct times in their
lives, they have a tendency to live beyond their means. They need to be cautious
about the tendency to feel overly-optimistic or overly protected. Borrowing from
their future and overdoing their indulgence in pleasures is a marked
tendency. While people with the conjunction, sextile, or trine between Venus and
Jupiter express their bigheartedness, tolerance, generosity, and magnanimity in
a generally constant and natural manner, these same expressions for those people
with the square, opposition, and quincunx between these planets tend to be
problematic at times. Their need for growth, good humor, and fun in their
relationships is marked, as is their disdain for insincerity. However, they may
attract just those kinds of people simply because they are looking so hard for
these traits that they assign them onto undeserving people!

<br/><br/>

Moderation is the most important, and perhaps challenging, lesson in these
people's lives.

<br/><br/>

Venus square Jupiter or Venus opposition Jupiter: You share freely
whatever you have, and your friends know they can always count on your
generosity and support, both emotional and material. Your good-hearted
acceptance and tolerance of others' foibles goes a long way in
maintaining harmony in your relationships. You also have a lazy streak
and sometimes avoid confronting difficult issues in relationships
simply because it seems like too much trouble and too petty. You like
to socialize and will use any excuse to celebrate with friends. You
cannot tolerate too much restriction by your love partner, and
encourage your partner's freedom as well.

<br/><br/>

Your sense of form and harmony extend into the important relationships of your
life. You seek a strong philosophical connection to match the physical
passion. Faithfulness is a key factor if your relationship is to support your
spiritual growth, and trust has to work both ways in the partnership.
