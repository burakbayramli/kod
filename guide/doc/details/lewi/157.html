Moon sextile Uranus: You act on unique and experimental thoughts. You are
humanitarian and freedom oriented in the way you explore life. You have a knack
for improving your surroundings. 

<br/><br/>

Moon trine Uranus: You take bold steps in your approach to everyday
problems. This gives your personality a sparkle and excitement that others love
and respond to. You know how to make excitement out of everyday activities, as
you search out new methods for performing routine activities. -- Interpretation
from the Indra Report.

<br/><br/>

Moon sextile or trine Uranus: You are creative, innovative and very original in
your thinking. You have a futuristic or modern view of life, which makes you act
freely, letting go of old taboos or traditions that limit you. You represent the
New Age man, being aggressive without being eccentric. You love your freedom and
you will be secure in any position that you occupy. You have a great inventive
capacity and you will excel because of your personal style.

<br/><br/>

Your emotions are spontaneous, changeable and enthusiastic. You transmit a lot
of energy to people around you and you induce others to act as they really want
to. You are very intuitive and can perceive clearly what happens inside another
person. You also feel attracted to the occult sciences and you can become a very
good astrologer, if you set your mind to it.

<br/><br/>

The relationship with your mother could have been a bit unusual. She
demonstrated much independence in her decisions and you have learned to act in
the same manner.

<br/><br/>

It is also probable that you travel a lot and that you are familiar with strange
and distant places. 

<br/><br/>

Moon sextile Uranus or Moon trine Uranus: You are uninhibited and
spontaneous and will often do something unexpected or humorous in
order to loosen people up and get them out of their ruts. You crave
emotional stimulation, excitement, surprises, and anything new. You
love to feel free and unfettered.

<br/><br/>

You can tolerate a great deal of unpredictability and insecurity (in
the sense of the unknowns in your outer circumstances), and thus you
are more willing than most to take risks. You have a keen sense of
adventure. Your ability to harmoniously adapt to changes and
unexpected twists of fate is one of your assets, as is your
receptivity to anything new, your willingness to experiment, and your
ability to completely alter your direction based on new information
and the needs of the moment. You stay open to possibilities no matter
how wild or far-fetched they may seem to more conservative folks, and
thus you could easily earn the reputation of being a bit wacky. Your
natural inclination to pursue the non-traditional or unexplored path
is apt to bring you benefits. At the very least, yours is an unusual,
varied, and exciting life, and sometimes includes extraordinary
discoveries. Also, you navigate through life using your intuition,
inspiration, and inner impulses to guide you (rather than some
pre-planned formula for living) and this will work well for you, as
your intuition is sharp and clear and relatively undistorted.
