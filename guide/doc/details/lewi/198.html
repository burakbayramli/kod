<p>
Your mind is always alert and active. Your thoughts and ideas are atypical and
eccentric and you rebel against impositions or limits to your freedom. You are
nervous, restless, somewhat arrogant and very particular in your tastes and
choices. Your opinions are unprejudiced and you are not afraid to voice them. It
is probable that you have difficulty concentrating on one subject for too
long. Your restless mind impels you towards continuous change and movement with
the consequent danger of leaving things unfinished. You like to challenge the
ideas of others and you show a lot of ingenuity and intelligence in doing
so. You must learn to relax more to avoid suffering from nervous
exhaustion. --Interpretation from the Adult report.

<br/><br/>

You are an original thinker, capable of unique discoveries and
innovations, but you tend to scatter your energies into too many
directions at once and to make impulsive or hasty decisions. You grasp
ideas very quickly and become impatient with duller or more
conservative minds. A fast-moving, mentally stimulating, and
unpredictable atmosphere suits you quite well, even though you may
complain about the stress and the crazy pace. You have a technical
bent and are interested in the newest scientific theories and
findings, electronics, computers, etc.
