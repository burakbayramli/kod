There is a marked cautiousness and defensiveness to people with a Moon/Saturn
conjunction in their natal charts, and it's really a self-protective thing, as
they are very sensitive. Their disciplined emotional nature may sometimes be
mistaken for coldness. Certainly, they tend to adopt a practical, business-like
approach to the world of emotion. However, they are very sensitive and fear
rejection. Some adopt a very cool exterior, leading others to believe that they
don't need nurture and love, simply because they are reticent about expressing
their need for these basics of life. There is a large possibility for a
self-fulfilling prophecy in this respect if they are not careful. Holding people
at arm's length seems to be their instinctive response, and it can be hard for
others to extend their own hand.

The emotional reserve and ability to detach themselves emotionally can certainly
help these people to succeed on a professional level. Others sense their
practicality and responsibility.

<br/><br/>

People with a Moon-Saturn conjunction sometimes take life (and themselves!) too
seriously. Throughout their lives, they may find that they relate more easily to
persons who are older than them, especially in their youth. If they are not
careful, they could develop a pessimistic view of life at times, feeling that
they are fated to suffer emotionally. At all costs, this defeatist attitude
should be avoided, as we often get what we expect from life! Some may be
attracted to relationships that include some hardship or adversity, and may even
tend to "come alive" when they are required to overcome challenges. They need to
try to avoid feeling guilty about "indulging" in emotional pleasure. Fear
can keep them from fulfilling experiences. When they let themselves receive
nurture or care from others, an inner voice cautions them that it might not be
sincere, long lasting, or enough! It may sometimes seem easier to withdraw
rather than take an emotional risk in life, or rather than let others become too
intimated with them.

Usually, these people grow out of a somewhat awkward childhood and become quite
poised in their manner as adults. There is something very trustworthy in the
aura about them. Some are quite hilarious, generally possessing a sarcastic
sense of humor. They are more able than most to keep their cool.

<br/><br/>

Serious and emotionally reserved, you were probably never an
exuberant, playful child, and you rarely express yourself in a
spontaneous, childlike manner. You are cautious about letting others
get close to you and sometimes withdraw from people altogether. At
times, even when you are with people, you feel lonely or
isolated. Learning to appreciate your own company and to find
satisfying solitary activities is essential to your emotional
well-being.
