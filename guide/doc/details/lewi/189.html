You appreciate aesthetics and have a fine sense of form, design, and
beauty. You could develop great technical skill as an artist,
designer, craftsman, or creative writer. You could also sell objects
of beauty - artistic products, cosmetics, jewelry, etc. You have the
ability to please and harmonize well with others and have a talent for
assuaging strain in the relationship of two other people. Your sense
of humor, tact, and personal charm are a great benefit to you in any
work with people on a one-to-one level.

Lovely words and a flair for description -- the artistic in all its many
forms. An inner sense of warmth and goodness, and the ability to express
this. Kind and easy to be with. Perfect taste in literary and artistic
matters. Harmonious.
