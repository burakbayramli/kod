<h3>217</h3>
<p>
Dynamic, self-willed, and fiercely independent, you have extraordinary
drive and energy. When you want something, you want it NOW, and you
act quickly, impulsively, and decisively. Your impatience inclines you
to be abrupt with people and reckless. You need a great deal of
personal freedom to do things in your own way and do not happily
conform to schedules, rules, or regimes imposed by others. You are
intolerant of authority and can be very rebellious. You are very frank
with others, sometimes brutally so. You may have an explosive
temper. High-strung and often nervous and tense, you find it difficult
to slow down, pace yourself, or relax. You are always on the go. You
are restless, daring, and experimental.

<br/><br/>

Like certain of the Christian saints, you tend to accidentally fall into the
spiritual experiences you need. This could be through a physical accident, or it
may be that your intuition and energy bring you to the proper crossroads again
and again.
