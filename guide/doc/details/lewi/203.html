<h3>203</h3>
<p>
People with a Venus-Uranus conjunction in their natal charts are usually very
magnetic, intriguing, and dynamic individuals. They value friendship in love and
sincerity of feelings is the most important quality for them. These are people
who will turn their nose at marriage, saying that it's how people feel about
each other that counts more than a marriage certificate. Although friendly and
usually quite willing to make friends with people from all walks of life, there
is an impersonal and noncommittal manner to them that is unmistakable. They
despise social pretenses. Despite the fact that they firmly believe that
popularity is much less important than sincerity, they are often rather popular
people. They love to be different, and in many ways they are open-minded when it
comes to love and romance. Still, they can be quite argumentative and sometimes
uncooperative--even downright inflexible--when it comes to their own "inner
code" and honoring it. They are not as adaptable to others' expectations of them
as their freedom-loving beliefs might imply. In other words, although they
easily accept many different people into their lives, they cling tightly to
their own ways of living. Some fear compromise, seeing it as a loss of self or a
loss of individuality. Their taste and "style" is different and original. This
can extend to choice of dress as well as taste in art, furniture, movies, and so
forth. Sometimes Uranus is projected, and the partners that these people are
attracted to display the Uranian traits of independence, originality,
unreliability, inconsistency, and freedom-loving. Ex-lovers of Venus-Uranus
natives may complain that these people didn't truly value the relationship. In
love and with regards to the erotic, the most appealing things can be what
hasn't been done or what "shouldn't" be done. Mixing things up and
experimentation are important to Venus-Uranus people.

You are excitable, spontaneous, and easily aroused emotionally and
sexually. You fall in love very quickly and have little self-restraint
or concern for propriety when your feelings have been
stirred. However, it may be difficult for you to sustain a
relationship after the first rush of excitement wanes, especially if
your partner is basically a conservative person who does not like to
change or experiment. Nontraditional relationships appeal to you, and
personal freedom is highly important to you.

Once you find the spiritual teaching that suits you, you are totally and forever
hooked into it. Until that happens, you may start and end many times. When you
are on the right path, beginnings and endings around you become cyclical
milestones in the development of your personal belief system.
