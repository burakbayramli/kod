You tend to act impulsively and yet you don't always take complete
responsibility for your actions! It is difficult for you to plan ahead, and
therefore your judgment is sometimes cloudy. This leaves much in your life to
chance, or fate, and makes it difficult for you to have total control over your
life. Learn to look very carefully before you leap and to examine every
situation from a realistic point of view.

<br/><br/>

Because you have a magnetic personality, others are drawn to you and seek the
pleasure of your company. Your active imagination is fascinating and inspiring
to others. In love relationships you may suffer repeated disappointments until
you learn to see your partner more realistically. You tend to look at loved ones
through rose-colored glasses, seeing only the parts of their personality that
you want to see. This may seem quite pleasant at the time, but it also sets you
up for future disappointment when your loved one cannot live up to your
idealistic expectations.

<br/><br/>

Even if you are astute about most people and situations, when you are personally
involved it can be hard to see clearly. By all means, be sure to deal with
others honestly and to demand that they do so in return. Be cautious in choosing
whom you will confide in and be sure to keep your friends' confidences to
yourself as well. It is advised with this aspect that you deal with drugs
(prescription and otherwise) with great caution. Take good care of your health;
you are more prone to infection than others, and practicing safe sex will be
especially important for you. You are more a lover than a fighter, you have rich
fantasies, and you are a most sensitive and imaginative lover. Your ideal
partner makes you feel completely special, and doesn't bring past lovers into
conversations in your bed. -- Interpretation from our LoveStyles Report.

<br/><br/>

You have a very active and fertile imagination and your ambitions are
never strictly mundane, practical, and concrete. You have a strong
desire to act out your fantasies, dreams, visions, and
ideals. Artistic creation, drama, or other areas in which you can
express yourself imaginatively are excellent for you. Ordinary life
seems drab and uninteresting to you, and you need to have some big
dream or something larger than your own narrow personal interests to
live for. Sometimes you may be confused about exactly how and where to
direct your energy and often drift along rather than making clear
decisions about what you want. You have a passive side and at times
lack the will power, physical energy, strength, and the fighting
spirit to achieve your aims.

<br/><br/>

Weakness of physical or spiritual strength early in your life tends to push you
toward the lessons you need. Indeed, you get help at the right moments to carry
you forward on the spiritual path. As you gain experience, you take on the
planning of your path as a conscious effort.
