Mercury/Neptune contacts indicate an active imagination, sensitive perceptions,
and heightened intuition. Your mind is open to the more subtle or spiritual
aspects of reality. You have a gift for sensing public moods and anticipating
future trends. In adversarial relationships, you readily sense your opponent's
motives and potential strategic moves. This skill is useful for fields as
diverse as diplomacy, creative writing, journalism, marketing, financial
investing, military planning, and psychic investigation. The creative and
imaginative aspects of Neptune often indicate a talent for art, music, painting,
sketching, acting, film, photography, and so on. You may have an interest in
studying Neptune-ruled matters such as oils, gases, chemicals, medicines, or
anything involving the feet. You could also be interested in hypnosis,
counseling, meditation, dream analysis, psychic phenomena, and spiritual
development. If this conjunction forms stressful aspects, you may have problems
paying attention or be prone to dreamy, nebulous, or illogical thinking.

Especially if any of angles
150,151,164,165,171,172,181,184,195,197,198,200,203, 204,210,213 or
214 is present, a tendency towards sensationalism will be dangerous.
If you have any of the above angles, the intellect must be protected
against any emotional turbulances.

Your mind does not function in a linear, logical manner and you are
often unable to express your thoughts in simple, everyday
language. Symbols, images, art, or music better express your
ideas. Flights of imagination and fantasy carry you into strange and
beautiful worlds, and you could develop the ability to transcribe some
of your perceptions to share with others, for example, by writing
fantasy, fiction, lyrics, or poetry. You are sensitive to nuances and
possess intuitive or psychic gifts, but you may become confused
between imagination and true perception. You have a strong mystical
and idealistic bent, and have difficulty concentrating your attention
on practical or mundane activities. You are strongly attracted to
metaphysical and spiritual topics.
