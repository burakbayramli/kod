Whether it's an infatuation or a full-blown love affair, relationships get these
people out of bed in the morning. They are passionate people who seem to need an
active romantic and sexual life to drive them. Often, this area of life is
somewhat challenging, especially in youth. As much as they want to be involved
in a passionate affair, their timing can be off and/or it's difficult to find a
relationship that mirrors their strong desires and expectations. Especially when
they are young, there can be a real awkwardness in their social skills--this may
or may not be apparent to others, but these people most definitely feel it
themselves.

These people are highly creative and generally are driven to express that
creativity. Their passion for romance is often channeled into their creative
output. For example, challenges in relationships may be a large part of the
drive behind their poetry, music, or other art.

<br/><br/>

Love and hate are very much mixed together with these people. They are prone to
love-hate relationships with others, likely because their passions are such that
the old saying "there's a fine line between love and hate" rings especially
true. Some level of competitiveness, anger, frustration, or angst is present in
their relationships with the opposite sex. In some cases, abuse is present,
either in the form of receiving or giving it. Although they are quick to anger,
they are generally just as quick to forget about it.

Venus square Mars or Venus opposition Mars: You are intensely amorous
and attractive to the opposite sex, and are not inclined to friendly
platonic relationships. There is much tension in your love life -
often because you put your desires ahead of your partner's, and are
impatient about having your love needs satisfied. The whole arena of
love, romance, and sex is endlessly fascinating for you and you are
not happy without a love partner. You can "burn yourself out" by
pouring so much of your energy into romance.

<br/><br/>

In this lifetime the erotic impulses of human love, desire, and sexual
relationships are a highly charged focus of your attention. Expressing your
sexual energies and personal magnetic attractiveness in ways that are loving and
respectful or at least not harmful to yourself and others will be one of your
issues. Dominating others through your sexuality or allowing yourself to be
dominated in this way is also a theme. Dissonance or turbulence in intimate
relationships, especially over differences in sexual drives or needs, must be
handled with care. Expressing your passion in ways that are compatible with your
own values and sense of beauty is the key here.

On another level, balancing and integrating masculine and feminine energies
within yourself is the challenge. Carrying or wearing watermelon tourmaline can
be quite useful along these lines.
