This is a difficult aspect in any chart, although it does have its brighter
side. Although you are impatient, scattered and prone to domestic and
professional squabbles, you are also energetic, ready and able to meet the
challenges you encounter.

<br/><br/>

Although you have the energy and guts to tackle the obstacles life hands you,
you must cultivate self-discipline if you are going to succeed in your
endeavors. Otherwise you will "spread yourself too thin" and scatter your
energies wastefully. Although you admire others who are successful, you must be
willing to put out the sustained effort required to achieve your goals.

<br/><br/>

Your greatest impediment to success is your impatience. If a project doesn't
"pan out" right away, you drop it and go on to something else which offers more
immediate results. This aspect will improve as you age, and you will eventually
learn to have faith in yourself--which in turn will help you cultivate
persistence and self-discipline.

<br/><br/>

Learn to set priorities and stick to them. And channel all of your energies into
one major project rather than scattering your efforts to the four corners of the
earth. You should carefully husband your resources, especially your own time and
energy, and plan your actions more carefully.

<br/><br/>

In a career you could excel in law, government, acting, media, public speaking,
writing, teaching or even sports. Don't be discouraged by the setbacks you
encounter on your road to success. You will eventually see that you can learn
more from your failures than your successes. Get up, brush yourself off, and
keep on going.

<br/><br/>

In your intimate relationships you will probably encounter much tension and
adversity. You may sometimes find it difficult to deal closely with others and
may even encounter problems with co-workers or employers. This is partly because
you can't take criticism gracefully, and you are prone to complaining about your
misfortunes.

<br/><br/>

Traditionally, this aspect indicates that you are accident prone. In truth, you
are likely to disregard safety practices and therefore set yourself up for
injury. Try not to be so impulsive. Also, be careful not to overindulge in
anything (work or play). Get lots of rest and watch your health.  --
Interpretation from Your Personal Path report.

<br/><br/>

The native has the feisty planet Mars in opposition to the expansive planet
Jupiter. This is a very positive aspect. The native will have lots of energy and
lots of optimism, with an enthusiasm that attracts. However, these little ones
may have some difficulty getting along with people because they are naturally
competitive rather than co-operative. This competitiveness is not
aggression. These youngsters simply enjoy a good spirited contest. But they
would find life so much easier if they did not treat everything and everyone as
competition.  This aspect can signify athletic ability. The child will
definitely need an outlet for abundant physical energy. Where better than
through some sort of physical sport? The natural competitive nature will be more
easily accepted in this sort of atmosphere too. This child will be very restless
and need a lot of freedom. These kids will not like anyone holding them back or
placing restrictions upon them. The outdoors will appeal to this sense of
freedom.

<br/><br/>

These kids may be rather clumsy, especially while they are young. There could be
a tendency to be accident-prone. The main problem is that this child is in too
much of a hurry. These youngsters get too carried away in the excitement of the
moment. 'Less haste - more speed' could be a good motto for this little one.

<br/><br/>

The onset of puberty will be exciting for this child but the compulsive urge to
grab every opportunity that comes along can be a source of total exhaustion that
will be ignored. Relating to the opposite sex will be relatively easy, but some
lessons on taking sexual responsibility will be needed. When <subject> grows up
and forms close relationships with the opposite sex, a sense of freedom will be
important. These individuals react aggressively when they feel emotional
stress. They will always tend to act impulsively. Any partner will have to give
this child plenty of personal space, and perhaps be prepared for him or her to
have some rather dictatorial views. 

<br/><br/>

Mars square Jupiter or Mars opposition Jupiter: *You are enterprising,
ambitious, and have a strong desire to succeed in a big way. Ever on
the look out for new opportunities and promising new ventures, you are
willing to take risks if you sense that something is going to be a
winner. No matter how much you accomplish, you never seem to be
completely satisfied. You always feel you can do more, and set your
sights on another goal. You feel frustrated in limited circumstances,
and you will leave secure and reasonably successful situations if they
do not offer challenges and potential for growth and expansion in the
future. You like to keep stretching your limits, to see how far you
can go. Sometimes you over-extend yourself or promise more than you
can actually achieve, due to an overly optimistic or overly confident
assessment of your own capacities. You relish healthy competition and
feel that it spurs you on to even greater achievements.

<br/><br/>

Your spiritual interaction with other people is generally quite fortunate in
nature. You gain an understanding of a wide range of spiritual teachings through
direct contact with others, and you develop the ability to resolve conflicts on
all levels of business and personal life in this way.

<br/><br/>

You have broad, expansive goals and will not be content with humble achievements
or success on a small scale. Enthralled with the joy of the conquest, your
desires and enthusiasm may gallop away with you. You often do not know when you
have had or done enough. Many things do come easily to you--athletics,
leadership, creative efforts of all kind--and you are apt to have King Midas's
touch, especially early in life. However, this may lead to overconfidence or
inflated expectations later on. In your work you are apt to be an overachiever
with an overemphasis on physical and/or sexual adventure. Once again, not
knowing when to stop or say no can be your downfall.
