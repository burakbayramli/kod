The Achilles heel for TT is their compulsive need for order ("My
survival depends on everything being in order according to my view of
how life ought to be and how others ought to behave"), and it can lead
them into the trap of unending search for perfection ("If only the
people around me were more perfect, I could relax and trust"). But
it's a bottomless pit: Since life and other people are never in a
static state of perfect order long enough for The Train ppl to feel
secure, their expectations can lead to continual tension and
anxiety. Because life - and others - are never ideal enough for them
to let go of control, they continually postpone trust and joy.  The
bottom line involves accepting that the universe's plan better than
theirs and that things are unfolding properly, regardless of how it
seems. The only place they can create "perfect order" is within
themselves, by surrendering to a Higher Power and trusting that
everything is indeed in order. The irony is that when TT people
blindly trust the Infinite and accept that everything contributes to
their greater happiness, they suddenly become aware of the larger
picture and begins to sense how things are working to their
advantage. Then they can let go of control and be happy.

What The Train Wants
</p>

<p>
What they really want is to be right all the time and to be the
perfect in the sense that they - and everyone to being total, perfect
alignment with "the plan" that they think is right. First they need to
turn away from rigid physical and material planning and refocus on the
larger, spiritual vision. Through trusting and surrendering to the
wisdom of the Higher Power, they can watch life's circumstances with
the conviction that what is unfolding is indeed part of "the
plan". Then the way becomes clear. They are filled with calm and feel
in alignment with "the plan" because the spiritual vision is the
energy of perfection they are seeking.  The Train rules enlightened
states of consciousness, the oceanic feeling of ones with all of
life. At times TT people have slipped into an enlightenment state - a
state of total connection with the universe. Their life purpose is to
nurture that state and make it part of their daily experience.

<p>
  TALENTS/PROFESSION: TT's need to have their own private office or
  space. They work very well alone and enjoy projects that involve
  discovering and carrying out a vision where the work is done private
  (such as research, library work , or computer work). TT people
  succeed in any profession that involves the individual pursuit of
  Spiritual Truth, including working and living in monasteries or
  convents. They can be fantastic artists, craftspeople, performers,
  or musicians - bringing their private dream to others. They are also
  great promoters, because they are so good at "behind the scenes"
  activities. Even if they work in a regular job, they need to allow
  themselves ample time for solitude and reflection.  TT people also
  have gifts for noticing pertinent details and analyzing the
  significance of information. When they use these past life gifts as
  a backdrop for manifesting their dreams, their innate practicality
  will help them. However, if they involve themselves in professions
  that stress attention to detail, in depth analysis, perfection, or
  accuracy (such as bookkeeping or systems analysis), they are likely
  to experience anxiety and restlessness. These folks are better off
  when their profession focuses on manifesting a vision, empowering
  them to use their practical skills to bring into reality.

TT people spent many past lifetimes as physical healers and helpers:
They were the surgeons, doctors, and nurses in many different
cultures. These were critical positions where they had to focus and
"do it right", because a person's life depended on it. Thus, there's a
lot of attachment to and a sense of urgency about doing things
perfectly in this lifetime.When things go according to plan, TT feel
confident and strong; everything's under control and the "operation:
is proceeding successfully. But when the unexpected occurs, they
panic. Subconsciously, they think when something has gone "wrong,"
someone's going to die.
</p>

<p>
As a medical personnel they had set rules and procedures - there could
be no mistakes. Thus, in this incarnation they carry overattachment to
doing things in an exacting, flawless way. They not only burden
themselves with this expectations of impeccable behavior , but they
tend to apply the same rigid standards to those around them,
especially in the workplace. Perhaps because of their past lives in
the medical field, they are often very health conscious, have a fear
of contamination, and feel a need to keep their environment spotlessly
clean.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, TT have had past incarnations representing spiritual
truth by being of practical service in the world through perfect, " by
the book" behavior - as monks, nuns, and "Mother Teresa" - type
people. They were role models; others looked to them to learn how
spiritual people should behave. Because their behavior resulted in
admiration and rewards, they have a subconscious association between
being "perfect" and having things in the material world go their
way. Thus, in this lifetime they want to release attachment to form
and get back in touch with essence. It's time for them to claim the
rewards of peace and inner contentment for their past - life service.
