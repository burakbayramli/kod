    The Achilles Heel of this person is a constant need to control. "If I can
    fix someone / everyone else's life, then I can focus on myself". But he will
    never be able to control enough things in a degree that will make him feel
    secure. When this person is taking responsibility for others' lives, he
    jeapordizes someone else's sense of responsibility. Ex-Manager people must
    stay away from seeking approval for their contribution, they must provide
    constructive support and <i>internally</i> acknowledge their support's
    importance.
