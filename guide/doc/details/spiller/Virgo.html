    The Achilles Heel of these people is their sense of victimization, of being
    wronged. They need to give up searching for a guru, a coach that they want
    to surrender to completely, because this search is a bottomless hole. Life
    isn't organized in a way to let them do this. What they need to understand
    is organizing their life in a way so that the outcomes they want will occur
    naturally. For this, they must actively participate in life.
