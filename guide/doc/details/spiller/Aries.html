  <h5>Traits to Focus On</h5>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Independence</li>
    <li>Being aware of self</li>
    <li>Trusting one's own drive</li>
    <li>Courage</li>
    <li>Being constructive</li>
    <li>Giving, within constraints</li>
    <li>Tending to your spritual needs</li>  
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h5>Traits to Leave Behind</h5>
  <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Seeing oneself through others' eyes</li>
    <li>Debilitating selflesness</li>
    <li>Being Mr. or Ms. "Nice Person"</li>
    <li>Obsessive attachement to fairness and justice</li>
    <li>Co-dependence, attachement to external harmony</li>
    <li>Tit for tat mentality</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The Achilles' heel such people need to be aware of is a preoccupation with
    justice ("My survival is dependent on everyone playing fair with me"; this
    thought should signal that they are on shaky ground). They are very giving
    people, but their sense of extreme justice and righteousness is a bottomless
    hole. This person should try to stop "giving" beyond their comfort zone
    starting to treat themselves "justly" for a change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Me First people must also avoid looking for an "ideal" and "devoted"
    partner. They should not listen to that voice that says "I will feel
    complete if only I can find the perfect partner". What they need to
    understand is that their sense of completeness can only be achieved
    internally, not externally through a relationship. No matter how perfect the
    other partner is, an Me First person would never get the permission
    to be oneself from the other person. They must take risks and follow their
    dreams and occupy themselves with hobbies that are meaningful for them. The
    irony is that once this person decides to follow this route, people who are
    compatible with them will appear in their life.
  </p>

  <h4>What Does This Person Want?</h4>

  <p>
    This person wants to experience happiness, compatibility and support
    with/from someone he/she loves. However in order to experience this, an
    Me First person must be his own life partner first. When he starts
    getting to know himself, he will start pursuing things that are pleasant and
    spiritually satisfying for him, and he will feel stong, supported and
    safe. As Me First person treats himself more justly, he will
    experience the feelings of justice and balance that he had been searching
    externally, internally. Only at that point he can form a partnership, with
    both partners sharing their emotional and spiritual life mutually.
  </p>

  <h4>Skills / Occupation</h4>

  <p>
    This person must pursue his own dreams with no outside limits formed by
    other people's suggestions and restrictions, for he is a leader, innovator
    and explorer. He will need an occupation which let him exercise his own
    internal impulses. Occupations such as being surgeon, technician, setting up
    a new enterprise are all suitable for him where he can freely exercise
    initiative and freedom of action.
  </p>

  <p>
    He will have an innate ability to see the other person's point of view and a
    skill to urgue diplomatically to bring about a sense of justice and he could
    use this ability as part of his occupation. He won't be as energetic and
    happy on jobs where using these skills is the primary focus rather than
    means to accomplish his freely chosen goals and life plans.
