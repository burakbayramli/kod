    The Achilles Heel for this person is selfishness. Interestingly enough,
    these people will never find an environment where their needs are constantly
    met first, instead, they have to find a partner to whom <i>they</i> can
    give. They will be satisfied if they are with people who can see who they
    are, appreciate them and respond them in return. The biggest trap for them
    is an endless quest for independence, but the life, the situation they are
    given is not organized to let this happen. These people will find happiness
    when they are supporting someone in such a degree that they are losing
    themselves in the relationship. Ironically once they do that, they realize
    their true self being and become happier.

    These people spent many previous lifetimes as warriors, they could
    only depend on themselves, they were on the battlefield. Now
    things are different.
