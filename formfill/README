Here is a collection of Python scripts that will allow you fill out a
PDF form automatically. First, you need to convert the PDF to a
collection of jpgs, using

python convert.py DOC.pdf [target dir]

In [target dir] you should now see DOC-0.jpg, DOC-1.jpg, etc.

Then, you need to identify box locations. For that use locs.py

python locs.py [target dir]/DOC-0.jpg

This brings up a UI tool; as you click on boxes, the coordinates of
those boxes will be written to a [target dir]/DOC-0.jpg.loc file. Make
sure you click on the boxes in a logical order, most forms specify a
number on the page for each box anyway, use that order for
instance.The coordinates are written to the loc file as you click, so
once you are done, simply shut off locs.py.

Which spot on the box do you click? Click on the left side of the box, 
Dont worry, you can add an offset later if the letters do not come 
out correctly. 

Now in [target dir], start a new file called DOC-0.jpg.fill. This 
will be a simple text file, each line carrying value for each box.
So Tkthis file will carry the values to be used to fill our your PDF
form. Each line in this file should correspond to the line specified
in DOC-0.jpg.loc. The line orders must match. If there are checkboxes
on the form, or you need to offset for any reason, to manually 
skip some pixels you can use

[down=30]x

The [down] command will skip a predefined number of pixels in the 
downward direction, and put the text there. You can also use up,left,
right commands. In order to change the default font size, e.g. to 23, 
you could use 

[font=23] 

You can use many different such commands for the same line, such as

[up=10][right=20][font=23]10 No Way, CA 10223

In order to place a newline, you can use \\ such as

[up=10]10 No Way, Big Address \\ CA 10223, USA

Signing

If you have a signature.jpg file in your directory, you can place 
your digital signature in the document as well. For that use, 

[sign=0.3]

The command above would take your signature.jpg file and rescale it by 
factor 0.3 and paste it in the correct location.

Once done,

python fill.py [target dir]/DOC-0.jpg

This will use the loc file, fill file, and generate a final DOC-0.jpg-out.jpg

In this file you will see stuff from fill file placed in proper
coordinates.

This tool uses ImageMagick, so make sure you install that first. Also,
for the necessary Python libraries on Ubuntu you can use

sudo apt-get install python python-tk idle python-pmw python-imaging
python-imaging-tk

An improvement to this code could be using a vision algorithm to
automatically detect the location of each box. There is a certain
visual pattern to a form -- words are in straight lines, there are big
empty spaces in between, and the whole thing is usually surrounded by
lines.
